"Why are passwords shorter than 8 characters easy to crack? (According to Snowden) [0] When you add a character to a password, the number of possible permutations goes up exponentially. [1] Lets assume we have a simple password requirement - only upper case letters. [2] Below are the number of possible passwords based on character count [3] - 1 character - 26^1 - 26 combinations
- 2 characters - 26^2 - 676 combinations
- 3 characters - 26^3 - 17,576 combinations
- 4 characters - 26^4 - 456,976 combinations
- 5 characters - 26^5 - 11,881,376 combinations
- 6 characters - 26^6 - 308,915,776 combinations
- 7 characters - 26^7 - 8,031,810,176 combinations
- 8 characters - 26^8 - 208,827,064,576 combinations [4] So, even in our simple system, an 8 character password has over 200 billion possible combinations. [5] ~~This is getting beyond a computer's ability to brute force (just keep trying combinations until it gets it right) ability.~~ [6] While this is still within the average computer's ability to crack, you can see how even in our simple system, more characters becomes more difficult [7] *Edit:  Look, I am not suggesting that an eight-character, upper case letters only password is a good idea or even used by most systems.

"What are surveyors doing when I see them looking through that tripod? [0] First year surveyor here. [1] The tripods which surveyors use are just devices for holding instruments level.

"Why is it a ticketable offense to ride in a car without seatbelts on yet a motorcyclist that faces the same risks with less protection doesn't have to worry with such restraints?

"Why do semi trucks leave behind huge chunks of tires on the road? [0] Can confirm what others have said: [1] They use retreaded tires on tractors in any position except steer (the very front two tires). [2] Retreading is a system by which a used tire has new tread applied to it at a tire plant, thereby making it a ""refurbished"" tire. [3] Retread tires are used on every position on a truck except the steer axle, only new tires go on steer axle (this is the very front two tires on a truck, if they are not new then they are against DOT regulation). [4] Is it safe? [5] By and large, yes, we have never had a major failure across the board in a retread campaign. [6] Do I recommend driving next to a truck or a trailer on the highway? [7] Absolutely not. [8] It isn't even so much because of the tires but because of the driver, sitting on the side of one they usually won't see you, if there is a blowout the tread may hit your car and damage it severely (we have large steel belts, sort of like in your car, but unfurled they would be about the size of your car). [9] Another thing is that if a retread blows then it could blow out other tires, the truck could swerve and destroy your car. [10] If you are on city streets being next to a truck is a lot like being next to a car so I wouldn't worry there but on highways I would suggest sticking as far as you can away from a tractor, especially one that has a trailer attached because trailer tire retreads tend to be several times retreaded tractor tires.

[3] You are less noticeable, less threatening if it does see you, and you aren't provoking it into chasing you by running, so other members of the herd that run get noticed, and chased down first.

"Why do Americans build homes out of nothing but wood in areas where Hurricanes or Tornadoes would do mostly nothing to a house made of brick or concrete? [0] I lived in central Illinois for my childhood and in coastal South Carolina for my early adulthood. [1] The odds of a tornado touching down on a house and not a corn field are slim. [2] Many of the towns and homes that dot the wide open farm land are from the late 1800's and most brick structures are important civic buildings or schools due to cost. [3] Tornadoes don't care if a building is made with the finest brick or cheapest pressed wood, in the end it eats what it wants to unless it's an earth home. [4] Earth homes seem to be the bane of tornadoes but nobody wants to bury their 100 year old home stead yet. [5] Architect's have more to think of when building on the SC coast not just because of the hurricane but also the swamps. [6] The swamps love to give full body hugs to heavy structures. [7] Most buildings really close to the ocean are stucco, brick, or hardie-plank and put up on huge stilts or foundation HOWEVER, some places like Charleston have historical buildings that can't be messed and still have wood. [8] Many of the cheaper more inland buildings have a brick veneer on the first floor and a slab foundation but homes close to the swamps are small and built of wood due to sinking (well, that's what I was told by locals).

"what were the reasons for the revolt of 1857 [0]  The sepoys , a generic term used for native Indian soldiers of the Bengal Army derived from the Persian word sepāhī ( سپاهی ) meaning `` infantry soldier '' , had their own list of grievances against the British East Indian Company ( BEIC ) administration , caused mainly by the ethnic gulf between the European officers and their Indian troops . [1] The spark that led to a mutiny in several sepoy companies was the issue of new gunpowder cartridges for the Enfield rifle in February , 1857 .

"Why do dogs live a shorter life than humans? [0] Let's say that a species is being successful if it can continually create viable offspring and replace it's individual organisms at least as fast as they are dying. [1] There's multiple paths to this in terms of reproductive strategies. [2] One strategy, is to maximize the number of offspring, even if that reduces the chances of any particular individual surviving. [3] An alternate strategy is a lower number of offspring, but taking more care to ensure their survival. [4] Dogs are somewhere in the middle, while humans are basically at the far end of the ""fewer offspring"" side. [5] And following those different paths through evolution has resulted in significant biological differences. [6] The human brain is significantly more capable than a dog's, but it also needs much more time to fully develop to the point where you get a human being capable of self preservation and successful reproduction. [7] A wolf (which dogs were bred from) is physically and mentally fit enough to reproduce and care for its offspring within a couple of years of its birth, can create a few litters of puppies, and then get old and die within a decade. [8] Over that same 10 years, a human baby will still not even be developed enough to live on its own, much less create and care for a baby. [9] If you assume about 15 years for a human to develop enough to be in a position to successfully create and care for a child, and then another 15 years for them to care for their child to the point where that child can be independent, then that's 30 years. [10] And that's just for one kid. [11] Before modern medicine came around, children died much more often, so the average mother might give birth to 5+ kids, so you're looking at being 35+ when your last child doesn't need you any longer.

"If wage gap exists between the sexes, why can't businesses hire more women as a way of saving money on salaries? [0] They could seek out women, but it is illegal to pay someone more or less based solely on their sex, age, etc. [1] That said, the wage gap doesn't really exist in the way that it is often portrayed. [2] Generally speaking there is little to no wage gap for the same work in the same field/position. [3] The wage gap is simply taking all income of full time earners of men vs women in the country and comparing them. [4] This ""gap"" of all overall earned income between the sexes doesn't take into account actual hours worked, education level, position, fields they elect to go into, etc. [5] Women as a whole tend to work less hours, in jobs that are less stressful/dangerous, have more flexibility with hours and choose to go into fields that are generally less paying than men. [6] This among many other similar factors is what contributes to the vast majority of the wage gap. [7] There's a lot of propaganda and misleading information in the news/media that try to make people believe otherwise, but it goes against all facts and data. [8] It's more of a politically correct argument than a sound/rational one. [9] The truth is that women are more likely to get a degree and in nearly all metropolitan areas of the US single, childless women earn more than men.

"Why did the U.S. government need a constitutional amendment to ban alcohol, but didn't to ban other drugs? [0] The temperance movement sought a constitutional ban, not a legal ban, so as to prevent the ban from being easily repealed. [1] A super-majority of the members of the 65th Congress favored prohibition -- but that was really an oddity. [2] Many in politics opposed prohibition, and anti-prohibitionists might retake a majority at any time. [3] The temperance movement enacted a constitutional ban to ensure that, without a 2/3 majority, Congress couldn't repeal the ban on the sale, transport, and manufacture of alcohol. [4] Opponents of prohibition also preferred the constitutional ban -- because it didn't include any provisions for enforcement. [5] They thought they could deliver prohibitionists a moral victory, while still using their power to block good enforcement. [6] Ultimately, they succeeded -- alcohol was banned, but everyone still drank. [7] Of course, this ended out being a huge disaster, but that's another matter. [8] Daniel Okrant's *Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition* details the nitty-gritty of the prohibition battle including the risk that Congress might repeal.

"Why does f.m. radio sound pretty good and a.m. sound like it's coming to us live from the 1920s? [0] The A.M. signal is a much simpler way to transmit audio through radio signals. [1] It was the first type to be invented, and the receiver needs fewer parts to make it work. [2] In A.M., there is a lower frequency radio signal that carries the audio, and the strength of the signal is ""wiggled"" up and down to make the sound come out of the speaker. [3] F.M. signals require a higher frequency, and more complicated parts to work. [4] The frequency of the signal is ""wiggled"" a little higher and lower to make the sound come out of the speaker. [5] When you turn on a light switch or have a noisy electrical motor, or during an electrical storm, there is a jolt of radio noise that interferes with nearby radios.

"Why do wounds itch when healing, prompting us to scratch and potentially re-damage the area? [0] Itching early in the wound healing process is created from histamine. [1] Histamine has been scientifically proven to increase the rate of healing. [2] But it does not itself cause the itching - it causes inflammation and this makes your nerves go nuts. [3] Your skin is covered in nerves and cells that cause the itching sensation from either mechanical motion (bugs, wind, etc), chemical interaction (irritants), and very low-voltage electrical signals. [4] A scientist discovered that the voltage at the base of a wound is different from the regular voltage of the skin elsewhere. [5] Why this is the case is up for debate but the mechanism at work here is that new nerve cells can follow this ever-decreasing electrical signal so they know where to go. [6] Once there and bonded with other nearby cells the wound slowly pulls itself closed. [7] Or if this is early in the process the bonds are stretched and pulled at by the histamine-aided inflammation and produces the same result. [8] Both the inflammation and the repair cause a small variation in the electrical signal and simulate motion. [9] The inflammation or removal of inflammation is the movement and the nerve cells getting the local voltage back to normal is the electrical. [10] Combined, these make your wounds itch like a motherfucker.

"how does the nuclear charge of elements in the same period affect their size [0] In single - electron atoms , the average separation of an electron from the nucleus is determined by the subshell it belongs to , and decreases with increasing charge on the nucleus ; this in turn leads to a decrease in atomic radius . [1] In multi-electron atoms , the decrease in radius brought about by an increase in nuclear charge is partially offset by increasing electrostatic repulsion among electrons . [2] In particular , a `` shielding effect '' operates : i.e. , as electrons are added in outer shells , electrons already present shield the outer electrons from nuclear charge , making them experience a lower effective charge on the nucleus . [3] The shielding effect exerted by the inner electrons decreases in the order s > p > d > f . Usually , as a particular subshell is filled in a period , atomic radius decreases . [4] This effect is particularly pronounced in the case of lanthanides , as the 4f subshell which is filled across these elements is not very effective at shielding the outer shell ( n = 5 and n = 6 ) electrons . [5] Thus the shielding effect is less able to counter the decrease in radius caused by increasing nuclear charge . [6] This leads to `` lanthanide contraction '' .

"Why do some bands, like Tool, not want to have their music on Spotify? [0] When you stream a song on Spotify or a similar service, they must pay the record company (or whoever owns the rights to the song) a royalty fee. [1] Depending on the band and how much clout they have, this royalty amount varies, but its usually fractions of a cent. [2] However, when someone purchases a song on iTunes, for example, the rights owner is paid 70% of the sale price (69 cents for $0.99 songs and 90 cents for $1.29 songs). [3] And therefore, in order for an artist to make as much off a song streaming on Spotify as they do off a sale on iTunes, someone has to listen to it perhaps upwards of 100 times, depending on their payout from the streaming service. [4] TL;DR: the payout from 1 song stream on Spotify is fractions of a cent where buying that song on iTunes yields 70-90 cents for the owner of the rights to the song.

[2] If you let all those cells grow, the ratio between old cells and new cells will usually be the golden ratio. [3] The golden ratio is so common in nature because it is the product of such a simple idea: the ratio between the first thing and the second thing is the same as the ratio between both those things and a third thing.

"what is the difference between alpha and beta glycosidic linkages [0] One distinguishes between α - and β - glycosidic bonds based on the relative stereochemistry ( R or S ) of the anomeric position and the stereocenter furthest from C1 in the saccharide . [1] An α - glycosidic bond is formed when both carbons have the same stereochemistry , whereas a β - glycosidic bond occurs when the two carbons have different stereochemistry .  [2] One complicating issue is that the alpha and beta conformations were originally defined based on the relative orientation of the major constituents in a Haworth projection . [3] In this case , for D - sugars , a beta conformation would see the major constituent at each carbon drawn above the plane of the ring ( nominally the same conformation ) , while alpha would see the anomeric constituent below the ring ( nominally opposite conformations ) .

"how did the new deal create a new meaning for liberalism [0] The realignment crystallized into the New Deal Coalition that dominated most presidential elections into the 1960s , while the opposing conservative coalition largely controlled Congress from 1939 - 64 .

"what is the rule for when easter is [0] For most of their history Christians have calculated Easter independently of the Jewish calendar . [1] In principle , Easter falls on the Sunday following the full moon that follows the northern spring equinox ( the paschal full moon ) . [2] However , the vernal equinox and the full moon are not determined by astronomical observation . [3] The vernal equinox is fixed to fall on 21 March ( previously it varied in different areas and in some areas Easter was allowed to fall before the equinox ) . [4] The full moon is an ecclesiastical full moon determined by reference to a lunar calendar , which again varied in different areas . [5] While Easter now falls at the earliest on the 15th of the lunar month and at the latest on the 21st , in some areas it used to fall at the earliest on the 14th ( the day of the paschal full moon ) and at the latest on the 20th , or between the sixteenth and the 22nd . [6] The last limit arises from the fact that the crucifixion was considered to have happened on the 14th ( the eve of the Passover ) and the resurrection therefore on the sixteenth . [7] The `` computus '' is the procedure of determining the first Sunday after the first ecclesiastical full moon falling on or after 21 March , and the difficulty arose from doing this over the span of centuries without accurate means of measuring the precise tropical year .

"What to people have to gain by claiming climate change isn't happening? [0] Two really key points that need to be straightened out first before answering you.
 [1] * [2] Very few influential people are claiming that climate change isn't happening, there's just too much evidence for it.  [3] What a number of people are doing is claiming that climate change (in the form of regional effects of global warming) is not being caused by HUMAN activity.

 [5] * [6] Different people have different motivations. [7] Some people honestly do believe that the ""truth"" is humans aren't causing it, either because their own research leads them to this conclusion or because they believe other people's messages and they're just conveying those opinions onward.  [8] So let's talk about the people who originally create those messages that others might follow, and answer your question.  [9] Many of those people sometimes have very strong interests in disconnecting human activity sources from climate change results. [10] They work for or represent companies that do things like produce lots of greenhouse gas, or produce and sell non-renewal energy sources like coal and gasoline.  [11] So their livelihood depends on people not believing that they're causing a potential problem, and they do their best to try and suppress that belief.

"Why do Americans build homes out of nothing but wood in areas where Hurricanes or Tornadoes would do mostly nothing to a house made of brick or concrete? [0] 1. [1] In extremely violent tornado storms that wipe out entire cities, virtually no structure, regardless of material, can survive the wind and still be within reasonable cost.  [2] Instead most houses in tornado-prone areas have much safer and cheaper underground shelters. [3] ([Here's a bank vault where 23 people took shelter that withstood an EF5 tornado](_URL_0_).

 [6] 2. [7] In less violent tornado storms the tornado will only travel through a very narrow path, so the chance of getting hit by a tornado is very low and it's simply not cost effective to tear down every house and replace it with brick houses.  [8] Most new subdivisions in these areas are stronger and can withstand a mild tornado. [9] 3. Flying debris is a major cause of death and injuries.

"Why do Canadians, or at least where i'm from, still measure height in feet and inches and weight in pounds if we use the metric system? [0] Okay, all of these answers are incorrect.  [1] The introduction of the metric system in Canada was a phased process that started in 1976. [2] Because it was phased, certain things changed before others.  [3] In 1984, Mulroney was elected and disbanded the commission, so no further metrification  took place.  [4] If it was done already it remained in metric, if not, it remained in imperial.  [5] Hence, you drive 50km/h but weigh 185lbs.  [6] It's 20C outside but 350F in your oven.

[2] Your basic key for music is the key of C, which employs the notes C through G and back to B again, naturally with no ""sharps"" or ""flats."" [3] These scales can be offset starting with a different note other than C. After this is done, the pattern of sound differences must be carried over to the new notes by using sharps and flats.

"Why is it a ticketable offense to ride in a car without seatbelts on yet a motorcyclist that faces the same risks with less protection doesn't have to worry with such restraints? [0] The clue is the less protection part. [1] In a car you have a safe cage around the occupants and a lot of crumple zones and airbags to keep you save in the event of a crash. [2] So the best place to be is firmly in place strapped inside the car to the seat where all the protection works best. [3] However in a motorcycle there is nothing protecting you in a crash. [4] You are already sitting on the outside of the vehicle. [5] So the best way to avoid injury is to get away from any potential heavy pieces of wreckage as possible. [6] You would rather have the bike hit something after you have gotten away then if you were squished in the middle of the collision. [7] This is why motorcyclists have protection to their bodies instead of on the vehicle.

"from material science perspective if possible, why we let the food cool down to room temperature before putting it in the freezer or refrigerator. [0] As others have said, the main reason this is done is to not to heat up the inside of your fridge, but honestly, 99% of the cooking people do at home is perfectly fine to straight to the fridge. [1] The only time you might have an issue is if say you trying to put a gallon of piping hot soup into a mini fridge, but a standard size modern refrigerator won't really be affected. [2] Having worked in kitchens for a long time, I can tell you the main reason we allow a soup or sauce to cool before transfer is mainly the potential danger involved in transporting 5 gallons of 200° liquid. [3] Since you are more than likely not dealing with this volume at home, it really shouldn't be an issue. [4] However, I wouldn't recommend going straight to the freezer with something hot, as you don't want to have any surrounding food in the freezer thawing and refreezing. [5] Instead let it cool down in the fridge first, then transfer it to the freezer.

"How exactly does our body inform us that we need to pee? [0] Nurse here. [1] Imagine your bladder being a balloon. [2] The balloon gets filled (with urine) and when it's about half way full, stretch receptors in the wall of the balloon starts sending signals to your brain that you need to pee.  [3] When you pee the balloon empties itself, and kinda deflates, meaning the stretch receptors are no longer sending signals to the brain about you needing to pee.  [4] Bonus info: the body produces on average 1ml/kg body weight urine per hour meaning if you weigh 80 kg you produce about 80 ml of urine per hour. [5] You start to feel the urge to pee when the bladder contains 300-400ml of urine.

"Why don't bugs take fall damage? [0] Two main reasons: First, they're very light.  [1] The force of an impact is proportional to the mass of the object involved. [2] Insects have very little mass, so they receive comparatively little force.  [3] It also means they have a low terminal velocity because the force of gravity pulling them down is more easily countered by air resistance.
 [4] Second, they're armored.

"Why are eggs so ubiquitously useful in cooking? [0] Egg yolks are incredible emulsifiers; they help fat-based and water-based substances form finer blends. [1] If you took a (pasteurized) raw egg yolk and added to it your salad dressing of oil and vinegar, you'd find that the the whole thing would form a creamy suspension that would stay together for a while.  [2] Meanwhile the egg white are basically water and protein, which as /u/mb34i said can do some pretty impressive tricks.  [3] The bonus is that the fat in the yolks, and the water in the whites already have an emulsifier in the yolk; the egg is a complete kit to emulsify itself and anything else.  [4] An omelette, or scrambled eggs, is just such an emulsion, cooked.  [5] On its own, the white can also be whipped up into a tight froth and used to add air and volume to something that would otherwise not be raised, such as meringue, souffle, or mousse.

"Why is it such a concern when Russia fights ISIS in the middle east but when the US do it(along with other things in the area), no one gives a damn. [0] Because it challenges U.S. hegemony. [1] The United States likes to try to control areas with instability, because gaining footholds increases their scope, influence, and power. [2] During the cold war, the United States was incredibly concerned about the influence of communism over the rest of the world, because it is at odds with capitalism and the United States way of life. [3] The Soviet Union's brand of totalitarianism just didn't fit with the United State's brand of totalitarianism. [4] After the U.S. ""won"" the cold war, the Russian bear went dormant and struggled to find itself and it's place in world domination. [5] Now-a-days, the bear is trying to spread its wings, and this challenges the domination the United States has over the rest of the world. [6] Unstable Middle Eastern and African regions are supposed to be controlled by the United States, and any intrusion into that control is going to be met with hostility.

[5] That's why when you pound the ground while you call them over or simply sway your hips a certain way they feel the need to give you feedback, whereas cats will look at you and judge you for being a strange servant who needs to stop trying to pat their tummies.

"If a star is 5 million light years away, then are we looking into the past? [0] You are ""looking into the past"" whenever you look at *anything*.  [1] Sure, that star is 5 million light years away, so what you're seeing is as it was 5 million years ago.
 [2] The sun is ~8 light minutes away. [3] You're seeing it as it was 8 minutes ago.
 [4] The moon? [5] ~2 seconds.
 [6] Your monitor? [7] A very tiny amount, but more than zero.
 [8] Edit: [9] As an addendum: the stars you generally see in the sky are not as far as 5M light years.

"Why is marijuana ""impossible"" to overdose on? [0] Bluntly put, the median lethal dose (LD50) of THC (the active ingredient in marijuana) is so high and the methods of intake so dilute that you would have to do absolutely impossible feats to have it occur.  [1] While there are a couple of different and conflicting sources, one estimate placed it at 40,000 times as much as the dose needed to get high.  [2] This is contrasted with alcohol, where five to ten times the amounted needed to get you drunk can kill you.  [3] To extrapolate, With pot brownies you'd die of sugar poisoning long before the THC got you.  [4] With smoking, you'd have to smoke something like 1,500 pounds of weed in a period of 15 minutes.
 [5] To actually manage a THC overdose you'd have to spend a lot of effort to first purify a sizable quantity of THC and then ingest it rapidly. [6] This would never happen accidentally.",[0] Answer (Summary) [1] Others [2] Others [3] Others [4] Others [5] Others [6] Others

"Money - If a bank takes a deposit and lends it out again have we got twice as much money as before? [0] Yes and no. [1] It depends really how you account for money. [2] If you look at monetary base (for simplicity, just all the cash in an economy), then the bank did not increase the amount of money.  [3] If you look at M1 money supply (which is monetary base plus checking accounts) or M2 money supply (which is M1 plus savings accounts and time deposit accounts), then yes the bank created ""money"".  [4] This in economics is known as the money multiplier. [5] It won't be twice as much because the bank has to hold onto a specific amount depending on the central bank. [6] In the US, most large banks have to hold onto 10% of all deposits before loaning it out or investing it.  [7] So if we look at a simple money multiplier, the bank would only create 90% more money after a single transaction.",[0] Others [1] Answer (Summary) [2] Answer (Summary) [3] Answer (Summary) [4] Others [5] Answer (Summary) [6] Others [7] Others
"What happens if I inject a needle(medicine, drugs, etc) into myself and it isn't into a vein? For example into my palm, or in a random place on my arm. [0] MD here. [1] Lots of medications are meant to be injected either under the skin into the fatty tissue (subcutaneous/SC) or into muscle tissue (intramuscular/IM). [2] For example, insulin and some blood thinners are injected SC, while most vaccines are given IM. [3] A lot of medications can be given either intravenously (IV) or IM or SC. [4] The main difference with the SC/IM routes is that the drug will be absorbed into the bloodstream more slowly, which may be preferable in certain situations. [5] However, other medications can be disastrous if they leak out of a vein (""extravasate""). [6] These are often highly concentrated, hyperosmolar solutions such as hypertonic saline, calcium chloride, or the IV contrast used for CT scans. [7] The result is often necrosis (death) of the affected tissue, pain, swelling, and compartment syndrome, which can cut off blood supply to the affected extremity and lead to amputations. [8] When it comes to recreational drugs like heroin, the intensity of the ""high"" is relative to how fast the drug gets into the brain. [9] Injecting into a vein, therefore, is going to deliver the drug to the brain in a high concentration within seconds, with the resulting ""rush"" that IV heroin users are chasing. [10] If you miss the vein, the heroin is probably going IM or SC, so it will get into the bloodstream, and the brain, more slowly, with a less intense high. [11] A lot of long-time heroin users have scarred up their veins so much that they have to resort to ""skin popping"", which is basically SC or sometimes a more superficial ""intradermal"" injection. [12] This often leads to awful skin and soft tissue infections and abscesses. [13] All those nasty pictures you've seen floating around Reddit of ""krokodil"" users and their horrid necrotizing skin infections are the result of chronic skin popping and IM drug injection.",[0] Others [1] Answer (Summary) [2] Others [3] Answer (Summary) [4] Answer (Summary) [5] Answer (Summary) [6] Others [7] Answer (Summary) [8] Others [9] Others [10] Answer (Summary) [11] Others [12] Others [13] Others
"How do people create these amazingly looking space/Milky Way photos? I can barely see a few stars in the nights sky. [0] Long exposure is one way to do it, yes, but astrophotographers also use a technique called ""stacking"", where they stack multiple layers of shorter exposure pictures over one another.
 [1] Some people prefer to use this method over taking a single long exposure because it's usually easier to fine tune your picture. [2] For example, if your camera runs out of battery, or something moves in shot that shouldn't be there, or you accidentally bump the camera, it's a lot easier to edit that in post processing and simply remove those frames rather than have your whole long exposure ruined.  [3] Also, this method might cut your shooting time in half.
 [4] But stacking isn't better than long exposure or vice versa and it's really all up to the person taking the picture to decide.",[0] Answer (Summary) [1] Others [2] Others [3] Others [4] Others

[0] Because you can't go to prison simply because the media or police suspect you belong to a crime family. [1] They need to convince a jury that you've committed specific crimes.
 [2] It's also worth noting that a lot of what we think we know about the current structure and membership of any given family is probably wrong or outdated.

 [2] Let's say you're in floor 4 and want to go to floor 3.
 [3] If you pick this elevator, you'll do 4 - >  20 - >  3.

"Why do websites make you have a complicated password when most account breaches come from a hack and not just guessing? [0] When people hack sites for passwords, they usually get a list of the hashed passwords.  [1] That means when you put in your password, the site can check if it's the same password you signed up with but it doesn't know what the password is.  [2] It's like a one-way secret message.
 [3] The way hackers figure out passwords is they know common hashing techniques and they guess common passwords using those techniques. [4] Since ""password123"" is a common password, they'll put that in the hash, see what comes out, and match that output to the stolen list of hashed passwords they got.  [5] If they can't guess your password to input, then they won't be able to know what it is.
 [6] Complex passwords make it harder to guess the hashed passwords once they're stolen. [7] The biggest factors for making a password hard to guess are the total numbers of characters you can use and the length. [8] So forcing you to have three special characters and two capitals and a number doesn't really help, but allowing you to use any character and requiring your password to be long does help.  [9] In other words, ""a%6L7"" looks like a more securepassword than""!X [10] XthisismypasswordforthissiteX!"", but the latter is actually more secure since it's longer and can possibly use just as many symbols.  [11] Longer passwords are harder to guess because the possible combinations of guesses increase quickly as you add additional characters.",[0] Others [1] Others [2] Others [3] Others [4] Others [5] Others [6] Answer (Summary) [7] Others [8] Others [9] Others [10] Others [11] Others
"If pimples and zits are caused by clogged pores around the body, then why don't we get them on our hands? [0] Acne is caused by sebaceous glands under the skin that secrete sebum into your pores.
