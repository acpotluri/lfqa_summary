"What is the purpose of the mesh lining inside swim trunks? [0] Originally the mesh was used as a lightweight barrier to block men's wee-wee's from direct contract from the fabric of the actual boardshorts. [1] When the cloth got wet it got heavier and would cause your sensitive bits to chafe and that's very uncomfortable. [2] More and more companies are starting to make boardshorts without the mesh now, however. [3] They are able to do this because of the inventions of micro-fibers and quick drying technology. [4] There's also a new stitch pattern called ""flat-lock"" stitching which is a non-abrasive stitch used a lot now in active wear clothing. [5] You'll see it a lot in Nike and Under Armour. [6] Source: Worked for both Under Armour and Hurley for several years. [7] EDIT: The underwear underneath the boardshorts seems to have some mixed opinions from what I've read. [8] I personally wear Hurley Phantom boardshorts without any underwear on and there is no chaffing issue.

"If humans can only hear sounds between 20Hz and 20,000Hz, how does it matter if headphones and speakers have frquency ranges that are greater than 20-20,000? [0] We can feel frequencies below our audible range. [1] Some film producers/directors use ""infrasound"", as in, sound that has a frequency of below 20hz to introduce suspension or fear in the audience to enhance a scene. [2] When you are walking on a suspension bridge and it sways, you can feel that, its still vibration, just not audible. [3] If the bridge vibrated hard enough and fast enough, you would hear it as it would push and pull the air fast enough to make it audible. [4] In terms of headphones, the effect of infrasound and sounds above 20khz are negligable. [5] That's because the drivers \(speakers\) in your headphones are more than likely too small a diameter to accurately produce those frequencies to a sound pressure level \(db\) that you would be able to ""feel"".",[0] Answer (Summary) [1] Others [2] Others [3] Others [4] Others [5] Answer (Summary)

"why do red blood cells live for only 120 days [0] The aging red blood cell undergoes changes in its plasma membrane , making it susceptible to selective recognition by macrophages and subsequent phagocytosis in the mononuclear phagocyte system ( spleen , liver and lymph nodes ) , thus removing old and defective cells and continually purging the blood .  [1] This process is termed eryptosis , red blood cell programmed cell death .  [2] This process normally occurs at the same rate of production by erythropoiesis , balancing the total circulating red blood cell count .  [3] Eryptosis is increased in a wide variety of diseases including sepsis , haemolytic uremic syndrome , malaria , sickle cell anemia , beta - thalassemia , glucose - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency , phosphate depletion , iron deficiency and Wilson 's disease .  [4] Eryptosis can be elicited by osmotic shock , oxidative stress , energy depletion as well as a wide variety of endogenous mediators and xenobiotics .  [5] Excessive eryptosis is observed in red blood cells lacking the cGMP - dependent protein kinase type I or the AMP - activated protein kinase AMPK .

[2] Anytime there's a story about a footballer demanding a wage rise because they're ""only"" earning £100k per week is generally met with scorn and derision, especially because 90% of the people paying money to watch them could only dream of earning that sort of cash.

"Why does nobody in America actually drive the speed limit? [0] Until 1995, there was a national speed limit law that required speed limits of 55 (later 65)mph or less on interstates and tied federal highway aid to states imposing these limits on state roads too. [1] As a result, a lot of states (especially out west) implemented artificially low speed limits and enforced them with ""wasting a natural resource"" tickets that charged as little as possible and allowed the state to say they were doing something. [2] As a result, you got a culture of taking speed limits as more suggestion than law. [3] In 1989 Montana, for example, anyone caught going under 90 but above 65 could expect a $5 fine, payable on the spot. [4] Additionally, people tend to drive at a speed they feel comfortable at based on traffic, road quality, and surrounding obstacles. [5] Things like trees, street parking, and pedestrians/bicycles tend to make people drive slower and open roads have the opposite effect.

"Why are flowers attractive to humans even if we might not get any reward (fruit, nectar) from them? [0] This doesn't address the philosophical perception of beauty, but primates' ability to see them in three colors is special, in the world of mammals: [1] > [2] Today, most mammals possess dichromatic vision, corresponding to protanopia red–green color blindness. [3] They can thus see violet, blue, green and yellow light, but cannot see ultraviolet, and deep red light.[4][5] [4] This was probably a feature of the first mammalian ancestors, which were likely small, nocturnal, and burrowing. [5] ...
 > Primates have re-developed trichromatic color vision since that time, by the mechanism of gene duplication, being under unusually high evolutionary pressure to develop color vision better than the mammalian standard. [6] Ability to perceive red[7] and orange hues allows tree-dwelling primates to discern them from green.

"If bad posture is so bad, why does it feel so good?! [0] I'll take a stab at in since none of the other answers seem to really pinpoint what makes sense to me. [1] I'm no expert, but I have a background in sports medicine and know anatomy and physiology pretty well.
 [2] ""Good posture"" as I interpret it, is using muscles to support your bones, mainly your spine and sacrum, in their proper alignment.  [3] Using any muscle means using energy and can get tiring after awhile. [4] When you slouch/relax, you relax those muscles, which can bring on a sense of relief.  [5] However, your bones still have to stay together SOMEHOW.  [6] That support then falls on the ligaments which attach those bones together and the connective tissue capsules around the joints. [7] If you rely too heavily on the ligaments for support you can overstress them, sprain them, and inflame them leading to pain.
 [8] In short, using your muscles to support your posture can be tiring.  [9] The alternative is using ligaments to support you which can result in vertebral and sacral joint pain.

"how come software companies have to wait for hackers to find weaknesses in their system and not just figure it out themselves before rolling out a software package? [0] There's an old story about a programmer that found the most obvious bugs in his software, then passed it over to his beta-tester. [1] Part of the game took place in a cafeteria, and the programmer had written a 'red herring' into the game: the player could take a napkin from the dispenser on the table, but the napkin had absolutely no use anywhere in the game. [2] The tester submitted a bug report that said, 'Game crashes when taking more than 999 napkins from the dispenser in the cafeteria'. [3] The tester had done something that apparently serves no purpose; since it was a text-only game, that meant that the tester had sat at his keyboard and typed 'get napkin from dispenser' 999 times in a row, for no real reason.

"Why does every steam game I install need to install it's own copy of directx? [0] Running the DirectX installer is not a matter of making sure your overall DirectX install being up-to-date. [1] Microsoft has a helper library with D3D called D3DX. [2] You'll find binaries for this like d3dx9_43.dll in your Windows\system32 folder. [3] There are over 40 different versions of the D3DX library for D3D9 alone, and many more for D3D10 and 11 as well. [4] Each game that uses the D3DX helper library is linked to a specific version. [5] As such the game must run the correct D3D installer version that it was specifically compiled with to ensure the binaries exist. [6] Even if a later version of the binary is already installed, that version cannot be used, and even if your DirectX install is up-to-date because you've run a more recent version of the installer that is not guaranteed to have installed all previous versions. [7] Even worse, if a version is installed for x86 it doesn't guarantee the same version is installed for x64, so 64 bit and 32 bit games may need to run the same exact installer version but targeting different platforms when run. [8] Furthermore, Microsoft's licensing terms prevent anyone from distributing the files directly, the only way to distribute them is to run the installer, that's also the only supported method from Microsoft to check that the correct version installed. [9] Trying to manually check for the correct versions is extremely complicated because there are numerous files that must all be present and individual system configuration options like dll search paths complicate the situation. [10] In addition, the dependencies and required checks may change in each new version of the D3DX runtime. [11] The code to check correctly and repair broken installs all exists in the installer and running it is a guarantee that the correct binaries will exist when you run the game and prevents lots of bad cases where a game would fail to launch with an obscure error if a windows install was either missing the correct version or somehow corrupted in the past.

"Why are people from northern countries taller and have longer bones if there is less sun exposure (due to shorter days in summer and generally bad weather), which is the main factor responsible for Vitamin D production in our organism, the vitamin that regulates bone growth? [0] Vitamin [1] D doesn't work on its own, it needs calcium which you can get best from milk. [2] Northern Europeans have better tolerance for lactose next to Southern Europeans and Asians. [3] There's also more and better land for breeding cows, especially if you compare to Greece or Italy where the land has been so severely over-farmed, there's not much growing there anymore. [4] Nutrition certainly plays a role on this too, but some differences between countries from similar regions can't be explained by that.

[6] Or other speakers of the Finno-Ugric language family, despite living relatively North are shorter than their neighbors. [7] Presumably due to genetic differences, since they're not as closely related to other Europeans.

"If most money is now just numbers in a computer, what keeps a bank from just adding a couple million to its accounts? [0] A banks is accountable to it's countries tax office and independent financial regulators.

[2] Financial regulators constantly monitor these reports to make sure that the bank has enough assets to cope with an unexpected financial event. [3] If a bank were to simply add a few billion dollars to it's accounting records, the discrepancy from one balance sheet to the next would show that this money was simply invented and the bank would be fined or (hopefully) be shut down by the regulators.

"How is it that, say, Lebron James and Danny DeVito are considered to be the same species despite being so physically different, but a brown bear and a black bear are considered to be completely different species despite being so physically similar? [0] Defining species is a tricky and often subjective part of the various scientific disciplines which interact with it. [1] Some will say that the viability of offspring among groups of sexually reproducing organisms is a good test, and it does offer some utility, but it is by no means exhaustive. [2] Polar bears and grizzley bears are a famous example of two types of organisms which are generally considered different species, but which occasionally mate in wild, producing reproductively viable offspring. [3] Mosquitos can become behaviorally different enough that they don't know how to entice mates between groups and they are often considered diferent species despite the reproductive viability of offspring created by human intervention. [4] Archaeological evidence throws in additional wrinkles. [5] Although we generally consider domesticated dogs to all be of the same species, if the only record we had of them were bones (ignoring DNA) we would likely consider great danes to be a completely different species from pugs. [6] This problem rears its head when examining hominids which co-existed as it is difficult to say if these are divergent groups of one species or two separate species; some the scientists involved usually prefer the latter result as it is more prestigeous to discover a new species than just a member of an existing one. [7] Non-sexual reproducers add additional problems as the detectable differences in species has a lot to do with how they look and how they behave around other similar organisms. [8] DNA has added an additional tool which allows us to statistically compare gene differences between two organisms. [9] This has been done to create base-lines of what we already feel are different species and how much their genetics deviate from each other and then we can use this to compare other similar appearing organisms, both those we can observe today and those from the relatively recent past. [10] If they are too similar, it is a strong mark against it being a different species and if they are quite different, it is a strong mark in favor of it. [11] In the end, the idea of 'species' is only important when it is useful in describing our world. [12] It's useful to differentiate between predators and prey, or the reproductive viability of populations of organisms, or tracking forms of organism through the archaeological record. [13] It is important to recognize that the walls we put up around species are not entirely sound and if we aren't careful we can make mistakes, but in so far that they are useful tools for helping us to grapple with the complexity of the world, they are just fine.",[0] Answer (Summary) [1] Answer (Summary) [2] Others [3] Others [4] Others [5] Others [6] Others [7] Others [8] Answer (Summary) [9] Others [10] Others [11] Others [12] Others [13] Answer (Summary)

"why are gay men often friends with straight women but lesbians generally do not hang out with straight men?

"Why are Whites in America often referred to as ""Caucasians""?

[1] Europe and Asia are one land mass (along with Africa) where Europe ends and Asia begins is arbitrary and down to historical reasons. [2] These mountains are one of the arbitrary geographical features that divides Europe from Asia (along with the Urals farther north). [3] In the 19th, or possibly 18th, century a German dude named Blumanbach(?) tried to divide the world up into 3 great races; Negroid were black Africans; Mongoloids were east Asians (what Americans mean when the say ""Asian""); [4] Caucasoids were European, North African and Asians from Europe to somewhere in India. [5] **This whole thing was psuedoscience** but it did not try to divide people by skin tone, rather it was by skull features. [6] Anyway, this dude had a skull of a woman from Georgia which he designated to have the definitive features of all Caucasoid people and theorized that this was where the first Caucasoid people originated. [7] The term was used in US legal system for who was allowed to enter the USA. [8] So in 1922 when a Japanese dude who had white coloured skin wanted to become naturalised they wouldn't allow him because he wasn't Caucasion, then one year later when a dude from India who was Caucasion said ""hey I want to become a citizen"" the supreme court said ""Yeaaah, about that, we know you are caucasion but we really only meant white caucasions, so fuck you"".

"in the USA, why are wait staff tipped a percentage of the food bill, rather than a flat rate? [0] The percentage rate thing basically comes down to perceived consumer control.

"what is the main difference between lymph and interstitial fluid [0] Lymph is the fluid that circulates throughout the lymphatic system . [1] The lymph is formed when the interstitial fluid ( the fluid which lies in the interstices of all body tissues ) is collected through lymph capillaries . [2] It is then transported through larger lymphatic vessels to lymph nodes , where it is cleaned by lymphocytes , before emptying ultimately into the right or the left subclavian vein , where it mixes back with the blood .  [3] Since the lymph is derived from the interstitial fluid , its composition continually changes as the blood and the surrounding cells continually exchange substances with the interstitial fluid .  [4] It is generally similar to blood plasma , which is the fluid component of blood .  [5] Lymph returns proteins and excess interstitial fluid to the bloodstream . [6] Lymph may pick up bacteria and bring them to lymph nodes , where they are destroyed .  [7] Metastatic cancer cells can also be transported via lymph . [8] Lymph also transports fats from the digestive system ( beginning in the lacteals ) to the blood via chylomicrons . [9] Interstitial fluid forms at the arterial ( coming from the heart ) end of capillaries because of the higher pressure of blood compared to veins , and most of it returns to its venous ends and venules ; the rest ( up to 10 % ) enters the lymph capillaries as lymph .  [10] Thus , lymph when formed is a watery clear liquid with the same composition as the interstitial fluid .  [11] However , as it flows through the lymph nodes it comes in contact with blood , and tends to accumulate more cells ( particularly , lymphocytes ) and proteins .

"how does a cladogram show the relationship among organisms [0] A cladogram ( from Greek clados `` branch '' and gramma `` character '' ) is a diagram used in cladistics to show relations among organisms . [1] A cladogram is not , however , an evolutionary tree because it does not show how ancestors are related to descendants , nor does it show how much they have changed ; many evolutionary trees can be inferred from a single cladogram .  [2] A cladogram uses lines that branch off in different directions ending at a clade , a groups of organisms with a last common ancestor .  [3] There are many shapes of cladograms but they all have lines that branch off from other lines . [4] The lines can be traced back to where they branch off . [5] These branching off points represent a hypothetical ancestor ( not an actual entity ) which can be inferred to exhibit the traits shared among the terminal taxa above it . [6] This hypothetical ancestor might then provide clues about the order of evolution of various features , adaptation , and other evolutionary narratives about ancestors .  [7] Although traditionally such cladograms were generated largely on the basis of morphological characters , DNA and RNA sequencing data and computational phylogenetics are now very commonly used in the generation of cladograms , either on their own or in combination with morphology .

"how do you determine what the root of the triad is [0] Although the safest way to recognize a chord 's root is , after having reduced the chord to close spacing , to rearrange it as a stack of thirds , there are shortcuts to this : in inverted triads , the root is directly above the interval of a fourth , in inverted sevenths , it is directly above the interval of a second .  [1] With chord types , such as chords with added sixths or chords over pedal points , more than one possible chordal analysis may be possible .  [2] For example , in a tonal piece of music , the notes C , E , G , A , sounded as a chord , could be analyzed as a C major sixth chord in root position ( a major triad -- C , E , G -- with an added sixth --  [3] A -- above the root ) or as a first inversion A minor seventh chord ( the A minor seventh chord contains the notes A , C , E and G , but in this example , the C note , the third of the A minor chord , is in the bass ) .  [4] Deciding which note is the root of this chord could be determined by considering context . [5] If the chord spelled C , E , G , A occurs immediately before a D chord ( spelled D , F ♯ , A , C ) , most theorists and musicians would consider the first chord a minor seventh chord in first inversion , because the progression ii --  [6] V is a standard chord movement .",[0] Answer (Summary) [1] Others [2] Others [3] Others [4] Others [5] Others [6] Others
"why is the cockerel the symbol of france [0] Its association with France dates back from the Middle Age and is due to the play on words in Latin between Gallus , meaning an inhabitant of Gaul , and gallus , meaning rooster , or cockerel .  [1] Its use , by the enemies of France , dates to this period , originally a pun to make fun of the French , the association between the rooster and the Gauls / French was developed by the kings of France for the strong Christian symbol that the rooster represents : prior to being arrested , Jesus predicted that Peter would deny him three times before the rooster crowed on the following morning .  [2] At the rooster 's crowing , Peter remembered Jesus 's words .  [3] Its crowing at the dawning of each new morning made it a symbol of the daily victory of light over darkness and the triumph of good over evil .

[3] For example , if one defines a function as def f ( x ) : ... , then x is the parameter , and if it is called by a = ... ; f ( a ) then a is the argument . [4] A parameter is an ( unbound ) variable , while the argument can be a value or variable or more complex expression involving values and variables . [5] In case of call by value , what is passed to the function is the value of the argument -- for example , f ( 2 ) and a = 2 ; f ( a ) are equivalent calls -- while in call by reference , with a variable as argument , what is passed is a reference to that variable - even though the syntax for the function call could stay the same .

"Why do so many European countries show hatred towards the European Union (like the UK), even though it has lead to the most peaceful and stable period in European history? [0] One thing people haven't mentioned is immigration. [1] Despite claims otherwise, immigration was one of the main reasons for the UK voting to leave the EU.
 [2] Countries in the EU have to let people from other EU countries live and work there with no restrictions. [3] This has resulted in a large number of people coming from less wealthy countries such as Poland coming to live in the wealthier ones including the UK.
 [4] Some people don't like this because they think these immigrants will take advantage of the benefit system and not contribute to society. [5] Although this is statistically not true in the average case.
 [6] Other people don't like this because they feel they are taking jobs that British people could have done instead, leading to greater unemployment.  [7] However now many British businesses and organisations are likely to face a shortage of workers.

"why do pimples (zits) on the inside of your nostrils hurt so much more than any others? [0] Real answer: [1] The tissue inside your nose isn't very thick and has tons of specialized nerve cells right at the surface, which means that when a pore swells with infection (a zit), the skin is pulled tight and the pressure under the already thin tight skin pushes against all those nerves, causing signals to fire and increasing the painful sensation.

"Is falling in love an evolutionary advantage? [0] You're looking at it from the male's perspective.
 [1] The female perspective is that she wishes to find a mate who will settle down to help raise offspring, thereby increasing the survival rate.
 [2] So it seems like there is absolutely an evolutionary advantage in ""falling in love"".  [3] The advantage is that the offspring has a higher chance for survival since there are two parents to take care of the child, instead of just one.
 [4] So it is more advantageous for a man to ""spread his seed"", but it is severely disadvantageous for a woman to hook up with a guy and to have him leave her all alone to raise a child.  [5] So there is a bit of a tug-of-war effect happening.

"Why Google Chrome tabs can consume up to 100-150 megabytes of memory while many of them consist just of kilobytes of javascript? [0] I am not a chrome expert, but there are a number of possible reasons:
 [1] The biggest offender is probably the chrome sandbox. [2] To limit the damage should someone figure out how to hack the browser, each ""tab"" is walled off from the others by running each in a separate process.  [3] Part of the increased security comes from the processes having separate memory. [4] The downside is that each tab is essentially a full copy of the application, and that results in a lot of redundant memory usage.
 [5] Another is likely to be memory management strategy. [6] It takes computing power to go off and free the ram when you're done using it. [7] In a language like javascript this typically means halting execution and looking for objects which are no longer needed. [8] What this means is that it makes more sense to wait until you're out of memory before you go off trying to free some up. [9] I know there are (at least used to be) places in the code where the javascript engine would intentionally leak memory on shutdown because it's faster for the OS to dismiss it (on exit) then to go through a full shutdown.

"Is vaping unhealthy? Ive read different articles, some that says it might be bad, and some that says its harmless. [0] The issue with vaping is that it is a relatively new way to use nicotine. [1] It took decades of research and observation to identify the adverse health effects to chronic users of other tobacco products, and it will likely take a similar amount of time to confidently identify any problems that arise with e-cigarette use.  [2] That said, e-cigarettes do not contain the same harmful ingredients as cigarettes, which probably makes them safer, although I can't say how much.
 [3] There have been some studies that show using e-cigarettes increases your risk of developing respiratory symptoms such as coughing or increased phlegm production. [4] It is possible that it could increase your risk for heart disease, although that risk seems to be hypothetical at the moment.
 [5] As far as cancer goes, while many of the carcinogens found in cigarettes are much lower in e-cigarettes, propylene glycol and glycerol (the main components in the liquid cartridge) both break down into several potential carcinogens.  [6] I can't say whether this makes lung cancer/disease more or less likely, however.
 [7] And of course, nicotine abuse is bad for your cardiovascular system.  [8] That has not changed.
 [9] TLDR; it's up in the air. [10] The general consensus seems to be it is likely safer than cigarettes, however it's possible that there could be some bad stuff in the vapor.

"What determines whether or not someone is a naturally good singer? [0] Physically speaking, being a naturally good singer means you were born with a good ""instrument"".  [1] Your vocal cords would be more elastic and flexible, and this would make your voice able to produce more overtones, or the right mix of overtones which sound pleasant.  [2] Overtones are basically sound waves on top of sound waves which have wavelengths that overlap on the original wave, e.g. half the wavelength, one third the wavelength, and we can tell the difference between a trumpet and a piano or a sweet and a shrill voice largely by picking up on the differences between the mixtures of overtones.  [3] Besides that, being naturally coordinated would help controlling the muscles which keep a steady pitch or vibrato or volume, being naturally gifted in pitch and tone differentiation would be important(good ear, perfect pitch), and because IMO natural abilities get a little too much credit with the general public, a natural patience, memory, intelligence, passion and persistence would all be very important when it comes to learning and practicing.

[0] Maybe it means something different where I'm from, but I've only heard of jamming a finger when specifically referring to the injury (most commonly occurring in sports) where your finger is ""jammed"" into the joint and feels like it needs to be popped back out. [1] That usually signifies a partial dislocation of the joint, also known as subluxation. [2] When it pops back into place, that's called a reduction of the joint. [3] It hurts like hell when it's subluxed because the misaligment causes increased tension (straining) or tearing (spraining) of the ligaments connecting the two bone segments. [4] When it's reduced, it feels better because the tension is relieved, but the strained/sprained ligaments can continue to be sore for a few weeks while they heal. [5] Reducing the joint on your own is generally advised against because pulling on the finger can do more harm than good, e.g. turning a partial tear into a complete tear, which will then require surgery, and also because these injuries can often be accompanied by a fracture.",[0] Others [1] Answer (Summary) [2] Others [3] Answer (Summary) [4] Others [5] Others
"How do bugs in games occur? [0] Hallo, Computer Scientist here.  [1] Bugs are almost never typos, they can be, but this is rarely the case as if you just misspell a variable, for example, your code simply won't compile.  [2] Basically, you push Go! and the computer just laughs at you in this case.

[5] Then, when the code (game, in our case) is running, it ends up being a negative number, and the code interacts in a way the programmer never expected it to.

"How can a side affects of antidepressants be thoughts of suicide? [0] The side effect isn't as direct as your post title makes it seem.
 [1] Rather it goes like this:
 [2] A heavily depressed person has suicidal thoughts/tendencies, however the depression is so deep that it negates the will/drive to do anything, including committing suicide.
 [3] On starting the therapy, the therapist realizes that any treatment will fail due to the absolute lack of drive and deep seated melancholia.  [4] He prescribes antidepressants. [5] They work as intended and increase the depressive persons activity level, thus making them theoretically ""fit"" for treatment.

"why green laser pointers cost only a few dollars more than red laser pointer but green self-leveling laser levels cost hundreds of dollars more than their red counterparts [0] Not my answer but an answer I found on a forum from 2004. [1] > [2] In a 640nm red laser pointer, there's a red-emitting diode and a lens to collimate (focus) the beam. [3] > [4] In a 532nm green laser (pointer or larger size), there's a BIG infrared laser diode that generates laser light at 808nm, this is fired into a crystal containing the rare-earth element ""neodymium"". [5] This crystal takes the 808nm infrared light and lases at 1064nm (yes, deeper in the infrared!). [6] This 1064nm laser light comes out of the NdYV04 (neodymium yttrium vanadium oxide) crystal and is then shot into a second crystal (containing potassium, titanium,  & amp; phosphorus, usually called KTP) that doubles the frequency to 532nm - the bright green color you see. [7] This light is then collimated (focused) by a lens and emerges out the laser's ""business end"". [8] Just before the lens, there's a filter that removes any stray IR (infrared) rays from the pump diode and the neodymium crystal. [9] Basically, with green diode laser pointers there are lots of itty bitty parts, and they all need to be aligned by hand. [10] If the polarisation is ""off"", one or both crystals need to be turned. [11] The overall process of making and the parts make the green one more expensive. [12] With red diode lasers, you just slap in the diode and slap a lens in front of it, which makes it cheaper.

"How did a 32 year old Martin Shkreli get to have so much power at such a young age? [0] Well business overall is a people game. [1] Those who are better at interacting with people who have money tend to do better. [2] In terms of Martin Shkreli if you have been reading the news he ran a partial ponzi scheme. [3] I feel he couldn't produce enough investors at a point to which he turned to price gouging for sufficient funding. [4] Overall I feel anyone can be a CEO you just have to know people and recruit. [5] Most people only seem to focus on the fact that they need to produce the funds to build a business when all you really need to do is prove to a rich person why they should invest with you and boom you can make any company you want. [6] I'm not saying you could sell miracle aids curing chicken to someone but skillful people could make someone wealthy believe that your chicken can cure or significantly reduce your chances of getting aids, it would be a very worthy investment.

"How are speed limits enforced by aircraft? [0] In areas where speeds are enforced by aircraft, there will be timing marks painted on the roadway.  [1] An officer in an aircraft overhead will time cars as they pass between these marks, and if a car crosses the gap in less than the benchmark time, they will radio down to a car waiting on the ground, which will make the stop and issue the ticket.
 [2] But this is expensive, as it requires at least three officers (two overhead and one on the ground), so it may not be used very often even when the road is set up for it.",[0] Answer (Summary) [1] Answer (Summary) [2] Others
"Whats the reasoning for Nordic Countries such as Denmark and Sweden actively accepting so many refugees? [0] it's called humanity.
 [1] Scandinavian people are more concerned with who they are and what they will become then they are concerned with who others are and what they could do to them.
 [2] They see the oppertunity that people bring, not the dangers that they could create, and strive to increase the opperunity rather then obstruct it, resulting in less trouble from migrants and more positive results.",[0] Others [1] Answer (Summary) [2] Answer (Summary)
"How did the first single-celled organisms on Earth come about? [0] University Biology student here. [1] The correct answer is: [2] No one knows, and there is no real scientific evidence to help us understand why.  [3] NOW there are really good theories, as mentioned below, like abiogenesis.  [4] BUT it's not the like theory of evolution. [5] (one of the most solidly 'proven' theories out there. ) [6] There are literally mountains of evidence for evolution. [7] The evidence for abiogenesis is, well, hypothetical at best in my humble opinion.  [8] I do believe it, but more than likely, all life on this planet was the result of the evolution of some type of [self replicating amino acid,](_URL_0_)a [9] after which evolving life would be a simple matter of time and good environmental conditions.",[0] Others [1] Others [2] Answer (Summary) [3] Others [4] Others [5] Others [6] Others [7] Others [8] Answer (Summary) [9] Others
"How was the first Computer/Chip programmed, without anything to program it with? [0] The very first computers were large mechanical devices which were programmed by flipping a number of switches to various positions to indicate which commands to execute.
 [1] Later computers were programmed via [punched cards](_URL_0_). [2] Literal holes were punched in stiff card using a special hole puncher; the pattern of holes represented program instructions, and these cards were then read by the machine and the corresponding instructions executed.
 [3] The invention of the [Von Neumann architecture](_URL_1_) is what first allowed programs to be stored in memory alongside data. [4] At first, programs had to be carefully crafted in machine language using something like binary notation.
 [5] From there, assembly language notation was invented, then higher level programming languages, and the rest is history.",[0] Answer (Summary) [1] Others [2] Others [3] Others [4] Others [5] Others
"How are people expected to know the difference between a lawful open carrier and an active shooter who hasn't started shooting yet? [0] Stories of cops being called on open carriers are common. [1] That's why the vast majority of people who carry, do so concealed.
 [2] However, it's pretty easy to tell the difference between an open carrier and an active shooter:
 [3] Open carriers must have their guns holstered or otherwise out of hand, by law.  [4] Walking around with a gun in your hand is an illegal act of brandishing under every state law I've ever seen.
 [5] Among the few people who habitually open carry, many also make a point of dressing nicely, because they find it greatly decreases the chances that people call the cops.",[0] Others [1] Others [2] Answer (Summary) [3] Answer (Summary) [4] Answer (Summary) [5] Others
"What is happening when our brain is tired from studying but we are not physically tired? [0] Task fatigue. [1] The exact, molecular mechanisms of what is happening inside your brain is not completely understood but essentially the process in your brain that stops it from paying attention to other stimulus and only on the task at hand, in this case studying and not looking at Reddit, gets physically tired and looses effectiveness.  [2] The father you push this mechanism without recovery, just like a muscle, the less effective it becomes.

"Why can't we replace limbs like we replace organs? [0] Organs can function adequately without nerve connections. [1] As long as they're hooked up to the plumbing (i.e. blood flow) many of them will function just fine. [2] With limbs, the primary purpose of them is to respond to nerve impulses, either sensory or motor (i.e. feeling and moving).  [3] Connecting nerves is tricky even when it's re-attaching your own extremities. [4] Transplanting someone else's onto yours is turning the difficultly up to 11.

"why do car companies make insanely cool concept cars and then when the cars are released to market, they look like regular old cars? [0] Concept cars are usually hand-built. [1] They often don't meet all the regulatory requirements for things like safety features and they may not even have engines if they're only going to be displayed at an indoor show.
 [2] The purpose is to build hype for a future model and/or show off some new technology or styling feature. [3] The final production model, if there is one, will usually include a few elements from the concept.",[0] Others [1] Answer (Summary) [2] Answer (Summary) [3] Others
"Why are the ceilings in so many grocery stores so high? [0] It makes the store feel open and less crowded, and it lets you set up displays that take advantage of the height, such as signs visible anywhere in the store.  [1] It also makes moving things with machinery like forklifts easier. [2] Psychological experiments have shown that people don't like being in areas with low ceilings.

"Why does everything seem so interesting while I am procrastinating? [0] Tl;dr, eli5: Our brains reward us for avoiding threats by releasing feel good chemicals which makes everything else seem rewarding.  [1] It's because avoiding things that seem scary, threatening, or overwhelming feels good and is really reinforcing.  [2] For example, think about a time where the professor forgot to show up for an exam that you were nervous about or something similar.  [3] The world takes on a brighter hue right? [4] Our brains are programmed to release feel good chemicals when we dodge threats.
