"How do computers choose ""random"" numbers? [0] You start with a sort-of-random number. [1] Often something like ""the number of milliseconds since January 1st 1970"" is close enough to random to count, but if you want to be really random, you base it off of something like whatever random noise the computer's microphone picks up or the airflow readings around the hard drive. [2] Then you put that number through some super messy and complicated math formula to get an even more random number. [3] Then you can feed that number back into the same calculation to get another number. [4] These numbers aren't truly random, but it's close enough for almost all purposes.",[0] Others [1] Answer (Summary) [2] Answer (Summary) [3] Answer (Summary) [4] Answer (Summary)
"What happens when a police officer pulls someone over who doesn't speak english? [0] They'll hold you there until they find a way to translate, usually by radioing in for someone who speaks the language.

"in the USA, why are wait staff tipped a percentage of the food bill, rather than a flat rate? [0] Tipping is not really 'tipping' in the US. [1] It is treated a (percentage) tax for wait service. [2] The more the bill, the higher the cost - but the percentage remains the same. [3] Similar to Sales Tax on Goods. [4] Your designer shirt will cost more in tax compared to the clearance bin, even though the tax percentage is the same - and the shirt is the same size. [5] It accomplishes two things. [6] The first thing is passes the cost of employment onto the customer. [7] This allows restaurants to spend more money on quality ingredients, chefs, fixtures, etc. [8] The second thing is that it provides incentive for quality service. [9] Since the 'tax' is 'flexible', waiters want to assure they get the most money. [10] The system works very well, actually. [11] If you don't want to pay the 'tax', you're free to get take-away without paying tip and save on 20%. [12] If you have a bad experience, you can pay less whilst making a statement. [13] Lastly, high-end waiters and bartenders make a lot of money - even if their base pay is $3.

"Why do online retailers like Amazon stick with MP3 instead of transitioning to lossless FLAC? [0] The likely reason is compatibility. [1] Many more devices and programs play MP3 than FLAC. [2] For example, the Ipod, arguably the most popular portable audio player, doesn't play FLAC(or at least, didn't the last I knew). [3] If Amazon sold audio files in FLAC, they'd either have to: [4] 1.  Also offer the MP3, thus doubling the size of their stock
2. [5] Offer support for converting to MP3, thus increasing their tech support needs, and losing themselves customers. [6] 3.  Refuse to support non-FLAC uses, which means they'd not be compatible with Ipods and other non-FLAC players.

[3] Shows that give away large prizes like a million bucks use insurance. [4] They know that only a few people a year are going to win the $1 million.

"how does nitrogen fixation play a role in the nitrogen cycle [0] The conversion of nitrogen gas ( N ) into nitrates and nitrites through atmospheric , industrial and biological processes is called nitrogen fixation .  [1] Atmospheric nitrogen must be processed , or `` fixed '' , into a usable form to be taken up by plants .  [2] Between 5x10 and 10x10 g per year are fixed by lightning strikes , but most fixation is done by free - living or symbiotic bacteria known as diazotrophs .  [3] These bacteria have the nitrogenase enzyme that combines gaseous nitrogen with hydrogen to produce ammonia , which is converted by the bacteria into other organic compounds .  [4] Most biological nitrogen fixation occurs by the activity of Mo - nitrogenase , found in a wide variety of bacteria and some Archaea .  [5] Mo - nitrogenase is a complex two - component enzyme that has multiple metal - containing prosthetic groups . [6] An example of free - living bacteria is Azotobacter . [7] Symbiotic nitrogen - fixing bacteria such as Rhizobium usually live in the root nodules of legumes ( such as peas , alfalfa , and locust trees ) .  [8] Here they form a mutualistic relationship with the plant , producing ammonia in exchange for carbohydrates .  [9] Because of this relationship , legumes will often increase the nitrogen content of nitrogen - poor soils .  [10] A few non-legumes can also form such symbioses . [11] Today , about 30 % of the total fixed nitrogen is produced industrially using the Haber - Bosch process , which uses high temperatures and pressures to convert nitrogen gas and a hydrogen source ( natural gas or petroleum ) into ammonia .

"How did sheep shed their wool before the emergence of humans? [0] Humans have selectively bred a small number of species to help provide better for human needs at the expense of the animals natural survival. [1] Sheep are one of those species. [2] Prior to domestication sheep would have grown a much smaller amount of wool up to the point where it served their needs, like the hair on a bear or a wolf. [3] It doesn't grow indefinitely. [4] Then humans came along and found these relatively docile sheep sitting around and someone realised their wool was very useful to make things like clothing out of. [5] Over many generations humans captured and bred these sheep to harvest their wool from. [6] Humans also realised that by breeding the males and females with the most and best wool, the offspring would usually end up with even more wool than the parents. [7] By repeating this process over time we ended up with the types of sheep we have today, who are completely reliant on humans to regularly shear them and remove the wool.

"what does it mean to be a master smith [0] At the New York Knife Show in 1981 , the first Master bladesmith ratings were awarded to : Bill Bagwell , Jimmy Fikes , Don Fogg , Don Hastings , Bill Moran , and James Schmidt . [1] Years later , tests were established for a maker to attain a rating of `` Master smith . '' [2] The tests for Master smith include using a forged Damascus steel blade with a minimum of 300 layers and fashioned as a `` stick tang knife '' ( as opposed to a full - tang ) to cut a free hanging rope , chop through 2 2X4 '' pieces of lumber , and retain an edge capable of shaving hair . [3] Lastly , the knife is placed into a vise and flexed for 90 degrees . [4] The knife must spring back without breaking , must remain functional , and must not slip from the handle . [5] Once the performance test is passed , the applicant must submit 5 knives to a panel of judges , all knives are judged on balance , beauty , and symmetry , but one must be either an `` Art Knife '' or a `` European style '' dagger . [6] The first smith to receive the Master title under these requirements was Wayne Goddard . [7] Wyoming knifemaker Audra Draper became the first woman to hold a Master smith title in 1999 .

"Why do some people find GMO controversial when farmers have been modifying crops for centuries? [0] There are several reasons: [1] * [2] There's an aversion to food that ""comes from a lab,"" as it were. [3] * Selective breeding is generally between crops that are the same or very similar. [4] Genetic modification allows traits from other species to be incorporated into the crop (if you want a tomato that doesn't freeze in a cold snap, you could take genes from a fish that lives in frigid Arctic water, for example). [5] That freaks people out. [6] * GMOs are largely controlled by a handful of corporations, the most notable of which is Monsanto.

"What's the science behind waking up in the middle of the night after only a few hours of sleep feeling rested, only to get a full eight and wake up tired? [0] Sleep stages. [1] There are 5 different sleep stages; [2] * the 'on-ramp', you know when you're at the back of a boring class / lecture and your head starts nodding, literally 'falling asleep' as it feels like you've fallen if you catch yourself. [3] * stage 2, your brain waves start to slow down (iirc waking, your brain has a 'frequency' of ~20 cycles per second, as this slows you become more relaxed and eventually fall asleep)
* stage 3, this is 'deep sleep', usually the period where people experience erratic sleep behaviour such as sleepwalking, wetting the bed etc
* stage 4, now your brain is pretty much only producing delta waves, frequency of around 1-4 cycles per second... so slooooow! [4] If you are woken from this stage, you will feel VERY groggy and disoriented
* and stage 5, the stage we all know so well... [5] REM sleep! [6] AFAIK, it's the 15 mins of REM sleep per hour which 'refresh' you. [7] If you don't get REM time, you will not feel like you've slept properly. [8] This is why we feel so ughhhhhh after drinking, because alcohol interrupts this important stage.

"Why is it easier to see a white undershirt through a white shirt than it is to see a gray undershirt through a white shirt? [0] Light passes more easily through the finer, higher-quality threads of a lightly colored dress shirt than the less-refined, opaque threads of an undershirt

Grey is a closer match to the color of your skin so a lot of the light is absorbed in the shirt in a way that's similar to how it's absorbed by your skin. [1] (Looked into it before I went bra shopping ... [2] Same concept, I suppose)

"Why did humans start shaving? [0] I think at the very beginning stands hygiene: [1] You can easily get rid of lice by shaving, this ""cleaning"" aspect is especially true if you are in an area with little water so washing is hard. [2] Starting from that you have ""fashion"", which is responsible for all kinds of odd behaviour you cannot explain. [3] As soon as you have a society where you show that you do not have to spend your day working for life but have time for other things (you are ""rich"" or ""noble"" or whatever it is in the current society called) tending after your body (muscles, cleanlyness, clothing and of course hair, makeup, ..., and beard) becomes a thing you can do to ""show off"" and what you can ""afford"". [4] Again, fashion does hit and also embraces beards. [5] There are many signs of a higher social status, as brighter skin (not working outside all day), soft hands (not working at all), fancy clothing, fancy hair, etc... beards (in general or the lack of one) are just part of that. [6] The above is also true for soldiers etc, as others have stated. [7] Discipline is, even in modern armies, tied to how soldiers tend to their body. [8] That is first true to keep up the fighting ability, but also discipline and self-image. [9] I read a theory that the modern view on ""super clean shaven"" of the modern man started both with the industrialised cheap razor, so everyone could afford it, as well as with the first World War, where people liked to be *very* cleanly shaven so the gas mask would sit as tight as possible.",[0] Answer (Summary) [1] Answer (Summary) [2] Answer (Summary) [3] Answer (Summary) [4] Answer (Summary) [5] Answer (Summary) [6] Answer (Summary) [7] Answer (Summary) [8] Answer (Summary) [9] Answer (Summary)

"What determines whether liquid being poured out of a glass is going to pour out and down the side of the glass rather than straight out? [0] It's all to do with the speed of the water as it passes over the lip. [1] If the water is moving slowly then it will not overcome the force holding it to the glass (adhesion). [2] However if it moves quickly, the water has more momentum and it can break free and pour away from the glass. [3] If the water cannot ""break free"" of the surface then it will simply roll over the lip of the glass and trickle down the outside.

"When we say that solar power is not (yet) efficient, what exactly do we mean? [0] Typically when using the word ""efficiency"" in a comparative fashion for energy production the measurement refers to the source-energy relative to the converted usable energy. [1] E.G. if gasoline has X amount of energy in it, the combustion engine can only create about X*.3 of that to its usable energy (movement, in this case). [2] A solar panel converts about 20ish percent of the suns energy. [3] If we compare that to other forms of _electricity_ production (the most reasonable analogue for your not-well-defined statement) then we'd be saying that ""compared to the efficiency of capture of energy from coal and conversion to electricity, solar panels are significantly less efficient"". [4] The REASON we might emphasize this statement however is that increasing efficiency of the panel in this dimension is correlated with requiring less physical space, likely high return on investment of actual purchase of the panels and so on.

"What atomic properties determine the transparency of a material? [0] It has to do with the way that the electrons are arranged. [1] Electrons can also absorb photons to jump up energy levels - but only if there's the right amount of energy in the photon to do a complete jump. [2] Electrons won't jump up anything but whole energy levels. [3] This means that there has to be the right amount of energy in the light in order for it to be absorbed. [4] With light, energy is proportional to the frequency, which is inversely proportional to the wavelength. [5] This means there's a direct relationship between wavelength and energy. [6] This is why glass, for example, is transparent.

* A desire to pay lower taxes - under nationalised healthcare systems, the health costs of the poorest are paid for by those who are comparatively well off, which some people find objectionable
* A big problem is that many Americans have little trust for or faith in the competence of their government, and will oppose it's expansion into any industry

"- Why can't Native American tribes just sue in open court for what they're owed under treaties that weren't honored? [0] As other people have said, statute of limitations. [1] Is this injustice? [2] Some may think so, but there are very good arguments that it is not. [3] Imagine that the status of every piece of property, everywhere in the world, could be called into question, with its current owners called up to pay for the crimes of their ancestors centuries ago. [4] Where would it end? [5] Could the descendants of the Romano-Celts in Britain sue the Saxons? [6] Could the Saxons sue the Normans? [7] Could one American Indian tribe be sued by another for something that happened before European colonization? [8] A functioning system of property rights requires that a cutoff point be established, beyond which no appeals can be made. [9] (The moral basis for this principle is that someone living today is not responsible to the victims of his ancestors many generations ago.) [10] In a capitalist system, this turns out to be the best for everyone, as anyone who ""unjustly"" starts off with more than his ability would grant him, because his ancestors were conquerors, gradually sinks down to the mean level of wealth, just as the aristocrats in Europe gave way to the capitalist *nouveau riche*.

"Why do we still have car lighters instead of regular electricity plugs [0] Although most of the answers are true, or have an element of truth, they all seem to answer the question, ""why would it be hard to switch to household plugs in automobiles instead of the cigarette adapter we currently use.""
 [1] The real reason we still have the 12 V sockets is that a plug isn't just a set of matching connectors, *it represents a standard*.
 [2] Your household socket is shaped differently than your car's accessory socket because they support different types of power delivery, and the *products* that use them *expect* a specific type of power delivery.
 [3] Have you ever tried to plug something in at home and the plug will only insert one way, while other items seem to work either way?  [4] That's because your home socket is shaped so that products that need to can guarantee that they are connected in a certain way. [5] Likewise, you can't plug your coffee maker into your dashboard because the coffee maker expects a certain voltage, power delivery mechanism, and minimum available amperage--none of which is commonly available in a car.

"Why does my nose clog and block my air passage ways? [0] The inside of your nose, sinuses, and the nasal passage is covered by something called a 'mucous membrane'. [1] Think of it like a wet carpet that has miniature water sprinklers, if you will. [2] The function of such an arrangement is to make sure that the air reaching your lungs is not dry (which would in turn make your lungs dry, which is dangerous), amongst other things. [3] Come winter, and a large number of viruses find it a very conducive environment to harbour themselves in your nasal mucous membrane. [4] These in turn cause the glands secreting the mucus (the miniature water sprinklers) to work overtime. [5] The purpose of this is to wash out the virus, broadly speaking. [6] But as a result of this, mucus is produced in excess. [7] When you're awake, this dribbles down the back of your throat due to gravity, not making its presence felt for the most part. [8] When you're asleep, it becomes difficult for this to happen. [9] So, it accumulates and dries up. [10] This is why you get a clogged nasal passage. [11] Another reason is that the miniature arteries carrying blood to the mucous membrane dilate themselves in response to the infection.

"What is it like to have a sense of smell? [0] I'll use hearing as an analogy, since it's closest in my mind. [1] Imagine that every chemical in the world made its own sound. [2] I don't mean like the difference between the musical notes A# and D, but like the difference between a flute playing A# and a blender with rocks in it. [3] Smell is that rich and complex of an experience, compared to the simpler colors  &  brightness of vision. [4] Like sounds, you can smell things over long distances without direct line of sight, and it's hard to completely block out, even if you pinch off the pass to the organ sensing it. [5] Some smells drown out others, and some come through clearly no matter what (like a baby crying). [6] Some smells are pleasant and stir emotions (particularly primal ones like hunger, lust, and safety), and some are incredibly annoying or even painful. [7] Some differences are that you filter out background smells faster and more completely than sounds; you don't usually smell yourself at all, whereas you do hear a distorted version of your own voice always. [8] It's harder to be overwhelmed by odors unless they come from gasses that cause other physiological effects (e.g. ammonia), whereas deafening sounds will cause permanent damage. [9] It's hard to impossible to burn out smell from overexposure to non-toxic chemicals. [10] On the other hand, bad smells can make it hard to breathe and make you nauseous.

"Why does air come up from underwater in bubbles instead of a constant flow of air [0] When you have air under water, the water molecules would rather be next to other water molecules rather than air molecules. [1] By forming a bubble, the air molecules are able to form a shape which minimizes the amount of air which is next to a water molecule. [2] Another way to think about it:  Imagine a giant field packed with 100,000 Boston Red Sox fans and 10,000 Yankee fans. [3] The Yankee fans are greatly outnumbered and dispersed in a crowd of Red Sox Fans. [4] Given that a Yankee fan would much rather be next to another Yankee fan than a Red Sox fan, we can imagine that any Yankee fan would look around and try to walk towards the nearest group of Yankee fans so that they could cheer together. [5] Once there were enough Yankee fans in one area, they would form into a circle, so that only the Yankee fans on the outside had to be next to Red Sox fans, and the rest of them could be surrounded by other Yankee fans. [6] If you want to go even deeper, the Yankee fans could move towards the edge of the field if they were close enough to see it, so that only one side of them had to be next to the Red Sox fans, as they would rather stand next to a wall than next to a Red Sox fan. [7] Then they would form a semi-circle.

"Why does garlic smell good to us when it’s cooking, but as soon as it’s on someone’s breath it’s revolting? [0] Garlic's pungent, but generally pleasant smell is due to a variety of sulfur compounds. [1] As these are broken down by bacteria and our digestive systems, these sulfur compounds convert into much less pleasant smelling ones. [2] This is only partially what makes garlic breath so pungent. [3] Some of the metabolic products enter our bloodstream and are subsequently volatilized through our lungs.

"What is a quark? [0] **Matter** (in the everyday sense) is made of **molecules**, which are made of **atoms**, which are made of _particles_: **protons**, **neutrons** and **electrons**. [1] That seemed to be the whole story, and that the component particles of atoms were ""fundamental"" — they weren't made of anything else, they were just kind of themselves. [2] But then we found out that **protons and neutrons are actually made of smaller particles**, which are called ""**quarks**"". [3] Quarks have some interesting properties. [4] It turns out that quarks have six different ""flavors"" -- just intrinsically different varieties. [5] There are only a handful of stable combinations of flavors that will last when they clump together. [6] Other combos break down quickly or never form at all. [7] And most importantly and weirdly, they can't be separated — they can only exist in these combos. [8] Particles made of combinations of quarks are called, as a family, ""**hadrons**"". [9] The protons and neutrons we know so well from our daily lives are the most stable combination of quarks, which are made of just two flavors called ""up"" and ""down"" quarks. [10] These are also the most stable flavors of quarks — other flavors quickly decay into up and downs. [11] But there are also more exotic combinations of quarks that show up as relatively short-lived particles in cosmic rays and stuff.

"how does an observer ""collapse"" the wave equation? [0] When we say we ""look"" at things that are very small, we don't mean we look with our eyes, not even with a very powerful microscope, we are looking at things that are smaller than the waves that make light. [1] The equipment we use to look at these things is actually ""feeling"" around and drawing what it feels. [2] We look at the drawings.

[6] Slightly older than 5: it has to do with the wave/particle duality. [7] A photon, for example, is a wave until it hits something, then it becomes a particle. [8] When re-emitted, it becomes a wave again. [9] If a photon hits our detector, it stops being a wave and stops following those physical laws and becomes a particle - following those laws instead.

"Why are jellyfish kept in a tank without any plantation or soil at all? They are always kept in a totally empty tank. [0] They are very delicate and extremely hard to keep in tanks for that reason. [1] They are mostly water with very thin membranes as their body structure. [2] Any sharp object can rip them apart fairly easily. [3] Of course, there are lots of larger jellies that have evolved to be more durable, or can grow big enough to withstand damage (like the Stygiomedusa gigantea, or the larger fried egg jellyfish specimens). [4] But the vast majority are small and mostly helpless, except for their unique stinging cells, but that doesn't affect their ability to survive in a tank. [5] In their natural environment, they usually just float freely with the currents in the open ocean, so there's nothing for them to bump up against (except predators). [6] They aren't strong swimmers either, so they can get stranded or trapped easily if the current washes them onto the shore or pushes them into a confined area. [7] In order to most closely replicate their natural environment, jellies need tanks with rounded edges to keep from getting stuck in corners, a gentle current to propel them around the tank, and a small amount of food suspended in the water. [8] They have very specific requirements for temperature and water pH, but I don't know those details, you could probably find them on an aquarist website, though. [9] No gravel since they could scrape against the grains and tear up their membranes. [10] No plants since they could get stuck in the leaves.

"difference in function between rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum [0] The endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) is a type of organelle found in eukaryotic cells that forms an interconnected network of flattened , membrane - enclosed sacs or tube - like structures known as cisternae . [1] The membranes of the ER are continuous with the outer nuclear membrane . [2] The endoplasmic reticulum occurs in most types of eukaryotic cells , but is absent from red blood cells and spermatozoa . [3] There are two types of endoplasmic reticulum : rough and smooth . [4] The outer ( cytosolic ) face of the rough endoplasmic reticulum is studded with ribosomes that are the sites of protein synthesis . [5] The rough endoplasmic reticulum is especially prominent in cells such as hepatocytes . [6] The smooth endoplasmic reticulum lacks ribosomes and functions in lipid manufacture and metabolism , the production of steroid hormones , and detoxification . [7] The smooth ER is especially abundant in mammalian liver and gonad cells .

"How did people in the olden days have sex without any forms of birth control? [0] Here's the most important thing to keep in mind: [1] First off, in a lot of these societies, if your birth control (spermicide or barrier, usually) or abortion (usually herbal) failed, infanticide was still considered as an option. [2] Second, if you're not well-nourished, it's harder to get pregnant, and as couples struggling to conceive will tell you, one drop of sperm in an unprotected vagina does not necessarily a baby make. [3] Third, access to birth control of some form is common to most human societies, but sometimes it was in some way ""secret knowledge,"" so it was lost in times of great social upheaval. [4] The stereotypical huge American families of the prairies, for example, might have had something to do with the fact that Ma had no one to buy pig-intestine condoms from . . . [5] In the ""fictitious portrayals"" usually what you don't see is women putting spermicidal substances in their vaginas between foreplay and penetration, or whatever; the right-wing myth of ""all of the past was like middle-class Victorians"" in terms of sexual mores is patently false.

"Why is marijuana ""impossible"" to overdose on? [0] A lot of people are citing good numberss but missing the important info that makes those numbers matter. [1] The peak plasma concentration of THC, meaning the most your blood can physically hold at once, is 100-200ng/ml.  [2] This is when your blood is saturated and can not absorb any more THC (Think about trying to dissolve salt. [3] Eventually you can't dissolve any more because the solution is saturated.). [4] This is also way below what we think a lethal dose would be for a human.
 [5] This means there is a limit to how high you can get.

[7] But so when people say ""You'd need to smoke the equivalent of Xkg an hour"" the important thing they are missing is that that is chemically impossible.  [8] Your body can not absorb THC fast enough to kill you. [9] **THAT** is why it's impossible to overdose. [10] If you did something to damage your kidneys or whatever so that you couldn't filter it out, and your tissues kept absorbing it because you literally were smoking tonnes per hour for weeks, then it's possible it could accumulate to a dangerous level, but really that would be the kidney failure and realistically you'd die of anoxia first.",[0] Others [1] Answer (Summary) [2] Others [3] Others [4] Answer (Summary) [5] Others [6] Others [7] Others [8] Answer (Summary) [9] Others [10] Others
"Why was the historical development of beer more important than that of other alcoholic beverages? [0] Beer (and wine and mead) come first. [1] All other alcoholic beverages are products of refining (properly ""distilling"") the various beers into stronger mixtures. [2] So to make vodka, for instance, one makes a potato mash, then ferments that mash into potato beer, then uses heat and condensation to separate the alcohol from the water, concentrating the beer into a liquor. [3] So beer isn't ""more important"" as a comparison of equals, it's a predicate. [4] So the invention of the wheel is more _significant_ than the invention of the tire, because you have to make the wheel _first_ and wrapping that wheel with padding makes it into a tire. [5] Without the predicate the follow-on technology never happens. [6] So without beer there are no other alcoholic beverages. [7] In general the historians talking about this subject are talking about the ""big three"" - beer, wine, and mead - when they talk about the discovery of beer. [8] Since wine needs specifically grapes, and mead needs the domestication of honey, while beer can be made from any grain or sugar in general, it's something of an understood generalization. [9] There is far more beer-making land throughout the cradles of civilization than there is wine or mead producing land. [10] So the beer is though to come before the domestication of bees for mead, the domestication of the grape for wine, the domestication and enrichment of fruit trees for cider. [11] So the various grain beers was likely first and foremost, and certainly lead to the invention of the other alcohols.

"Why does it take longer to build muscle the longer you've been doing it and fat longer to burn off the less you have on you? [0] While it varies from person to person, there's a general sort of ""ideal"" body form that humans have evolved to favor.  [1] Back in our hunter-gatherer days, a decent amount of muscle was likely very useful for survival, and a decent amount of fat was likely handy to have just in case of tough times.  [2] But eventually you get to a point of diminishing returns. [3] Having enough muscle mass to be able to bench press 200 pounds might be a great trait for a hunter-gatherer human. [4] But does increasing that muscle mass to the point where you could bench 400 pounds make you twice as good at hunting or gathering? [5] Probably not. [6] But all of that extra muscle mass does require more energy input in order to maintain. [7] (You need to eat more). [8] You get to a point where, in terms of survival in the natural world, more muscle is a bigger liability than a benefit.  [9] Your amount of body fat has similar tradeoffs. [10] Obviously having 300 lbs of fat would make life as a hunter/gatherer difficult in a bunch of ways. [11] But having very little fat reserves would leave you very vulnerable in times of scarce food. [12] In terms of natural survival, there's absolutely no reason why a decently fed human body would ever want its fat percentage to drop to lower digits.  [13] When you're trying to get your body fat percentage really low, or bulk up your muscle mass really high, you're fighting against your body's natural inclination.

"How does an ant not die when flicked full force by a human finger? [0] Multiple reasons: [1] The exoskeleton of the ant distributes the force more quickly across its entire body (due to being more stiff than fluffy human tissue), protecting more vulnerable parts. [2] The small size makes it more resistant to blows - this is because volume (and mass) scales faster than surface area (r^3 instead of r^2). [3] So smaller objects have a larger surface area per unit mass, which makes them move more easily even with light forces (like wind). [4] The mass is what causes inertia (""pushing back"" against your finger while you apply the force) and the force is distributed over its surface area. [5] So your applied force is distributed across a relatively large (compared to its volume) surface area (leading to a relatively low pressure), while the low mass (very low, due to aforementioned scaling) makes it easy to move. [6] This means you won't be applying your force for more than a fraction of a second before the ant is moving along with your finger, no longer receiving any significant force. [7] Since you're not applying this force over any time (or distance), the total energy transferred into the ant is very small. [8] This, combined with the effective armor exoskeleton, is why it's difficult to kill insects by swatting them into empty space, but if you push them against a solid object, they squash easily. [9] TL;DR: Resistant exoskeletons and general properties of small objects make them less likely to be crushed by an outside force. [10] True ELI5: [11] It's like trying to break a balloon by punching it in midair. [12] The punch is certainly hard enough, but the balloon just kind of gets pushed away.

"How poverty can lead to obesity? [0] First off, let's be clear that we're talking about a link between poverty and obesity in the U.S. and not in some third world country. [1] We don't have food scarcity issues (generally) that cause famine and/or mass starvation. [2] First off, it is expensive to eat healthy and preparing healthy well-balanced meals for your family only works if you have the time and means to do so. [3] In poor urban areas, it is much cheaper and easier to hit up the McDonald's dollar menu, get a big tray of chicken and rice from a food stand, or go to the grocery store whose shelves are loaded with enriched, unhealthy, processed crap. [4] There aren't very many Whole Foods' or farmer's markets in these neighborhoods and poor people who are working multiple part-time jobs dont' generally take the time to travel to more affluent neighborhoods to buy food. [5] Then there's the portion-size issue. [6] Portion sizes have grown in the past 20 years at fast food restaurants and also in stores. [7] Poor people want to get the most for their dollar, so they buy bigger, get the super-sized fries, etc... [8] On top of that, we teach/pressure our kids to ""finish their plates."" [9] There's more pressure when the $ you used to put that food on the plate is more scarce. [10] We're also talking about lots of single-parent households, fractured schedules, etc.. [11] Lot of eating ""on the go"" or with minimal preparation which lends itself to more unhealthy options. [12] And lastly, exercise. [13] Really poor kids get less exercise, and tend to have parents who are less involved in making sure they get it.

"Why are Monsanto considered to be evil? [0] Monsanto tends to get into trouble because of their tendency to employ strong arm legal tactics against farmers. [1] Specifically, they patented their seeds, so when you buy seed from Monsanto you're really just buying a license to a plant which will grow and produce its own seeds...but legally you can't plant those seeds because your license doesn't cover them. [2] So if you're a poor farmer in India and Monsanto's people convince you their seed is amazing and will give you a great crop yield, and you fork over all your money to buy their seed but that year your crop fails...now you're broke and you have no useful seed because if you just replant your crops you'll get sued. [3] And that's the best case, if you went into debt for those seeds now you're in the hole money you can't recoup without a harvest, but you can't harvest anything without licensing more plants...or totally reinvesting in seed from somewhere else...that you can't afford because you're in debt. [4] This actually cause a rash of farmer suicides. [5] Also since plants are living things they tend to attempt to reproduce, so if GMO wheat from Monsanto's research farm in Oregon spreads itself and ends up in your organic farm, your certifications are all in trouble. [6] If you're big enough to sell to other states or countries if they don't allow GMO wheat you can't sell to them anymore, your whole business is fucked. [7] This also happened. [8] Finally, if you're a farmer, and your neighbor's a farmer, and he buys Monsanto's seeds but you don't. [9] Some seasons later Monsanto comes over and realizes his crops fertilized your crops and now you're growing hybrid plants through no intent of your own.

"How does this vinegar/baking soda hot ice reaction work? [0] The clear liquid is known as a supersaturated solution. [1] In this case, of sodium acetate.

[2] Resistive touchscreens, which are used in Nintendo's products and pre-iP [3] Phone PDAs and smartphones have flexible plastic screens. [4] When you push on the screen, you squeeze multiple layers together and this completes an electric circuit. [5] Most modern smartphones use capacitive touchscreens. [6] These touchscreens are made of glass. [7] When you touch the screen with your hand, you distort the electric field in the screen and it can measure where that change took place.

"How can a computer that's been unplugged for a long time still know the time and date? [0] There's a small battery inside the computer. [1] Just like a watch has a battery and keeps time. [2] That battery lasts a really long time, just like a watch battery. [3] So, it's kind of like there's a watch inside of a computer, because that battery powers a tiny clock. [4] When the computer boots back up again it just reads that clock and bam, time and date. [5] Non-5-yo-version: Battery powers a Real Time Clock (RTC), typically running at 32.768 kHz, which in turn is connected to a tiny register of a few tens or so of bits that just keep incrementing once per second for all of eternity (until they eventually overflow, many years later). [6] When the computer wakes back up, it reads that register value, converts that number of seconds into a date and time, generally based of Midnight, Jan 1, 1970 + number of seconds in register = current time or something equivalent.

"Why are Conspiracies typically dismissed without investigation? [0] Usually, conspiracy theories **are** investigated, in some way. [1] Quite thoroughly, in any instance where there could be truth to the allegations. [2] But then the people who believe in them won't take ""that insane thing you said didn't happen"" for an answer.

[5] Like the conspiracy theory which states that the Queen of England is a reptilian space alien. [6] We can dismiss that one out of hand. [7] EDIT: A perfect example of a conspiracy theory that's been totally investigated to death: the idea that the moon landing was faked.

"why do bank transfers take days if they are 100% electronic? [0] One I can finally answer! [1] A lot of misinformation already in this thread about why the delay happens... [2] I work for a major credit card company and it's my job to find a way to get payments done faster. [3] The major hold up is the amount of time it takes to process so many transactions and the methods that we use (here in the US it's ACH - Automated Clearing House and Direct Credit) aren't the best. [4] Any payment made via ACH has to clear the Federal Reserve System as well and their process only runs once per day. [5] Direct Credit methods should be better since they eliminate that step, but the difference in communication tools, the times at when the banks run their ""processing streams,"" and the sheer volume of transfers all clog up the direct credit system.

[3] The universal motor is very similar to a DC series motor in construction , but is modified slightly to allow the motor to operate properly on AC power . [4] This type of electric motor can operate well on AC because the current in both the field coils and the armature ( and the resultant magnetic fields ) will alternate ( reverse polarity ) synchronously with the supply .

"Do ex-prisoners who have been found not-guilty a while into their wrongful sentencing receive any compensation for their unnecessary time in prison? [0] It depends on a lot of factors. [1] For instance, some states will only pay *exonerated* prisoners. [2] Note that being ""exonerated"" is different from being found ""not guilty"" on appeal or at a new trial. [3] ""Exonerated"" is defined by some states as being absolutely ruled out as a guilty person-- for instance, by DNA evidence. [4] It is not enough to be found ""not guilty"" on appeal because of, for instance, bad jury instructions. [5] Other states only offer compensation for people who are convicted because of misconduct by prosecutors or police-- not just a bad jury decision that is later set aside.

"Do men’s and women’s hygiene products (shave gel, lotion, face wash) actually do different things for men or women, or is it a marketing thing? [0] Most of the ingredients are the same, though some manufacturers claim that their gendered products are tailored more towards the different areas that each gender tends to shave more. [1] The main difference in ingredients is the scent. [2] Fragrances and oils can be incredibly expensive, which could go towards explaining some of the difference in price. [3] We know women place more emphasis on the fragrance of a product than men (some men being happy to purchase without smelling the product at all).

"What happens inside the body during diarrhea? [0] This can happen a couple of ways. [1] When you have substances in your intestine that aren't being readily absorbed into the body, the concentration of the substances is higher in the intestine. [2] Water flows from areas of low concentration to high concentration, so when there  is a greater amount of a substance in your intestine, water will flow in. [3] More water = diarrhea sometimes. [4] Another way is in certain conditions, such as cholera, water is continuously being released in the intestine regardless of the how much there is present in the intestine. [5] Yet another way occurs because your GI tract has a base level of motility; its continually contracting and relaxing to move the contents. [6] Certain conditions can increase the motility, so the water doesn't have time to be absorbed, and comes out the other end as diarrhea. [7] Essentially, there are quite a few ways diarrhea can happen, these are just a couple.

"How pizza delivery became a thing, when no other restaurants really offered hot food deliveries like that.

"Why is hand flapping a behavior common to many people with autism? [0] I have high functioning autism and while I don't do the hand flapping thing, I will on rare occasions drum my fingers. [1] I don't do it often enough or in rigid enough contexts to consider it a full blown stim, but I do find myself doing the motion in mid-air when I'm trying to remember something during conversations. [2] I usually drum my fingers against something when I'm extremely stressed or trying to find a solution to a problem or scenario. [3] Like a majority of people with autism I have Sensory Processing Disorder, sometimes referred to as hypersensitivity. [4] It dials my senses up to eleven and my brain does not have the ability to tune out portions of my environment or any surrounding stimulus, everything is processed at roughly the same level and understandably can be very overwhelming. [5] It takes a lot of focus to be able to 'tune in' to certain things; in my case spoken words if there are multiple sources of background noise, but it can be almost anything you would try to process/learn. [6] Visuals, smells, questions on a test, etc. [7] Stims are self stimulating behaviors that sort of comfort and calm the person doing them. [8] In the cases in which I'm drumming my fingers I can very clearly feel the interior movements of my fingers joints and how that interior motion is unbelievably smooth within the joint itself. [9] Combine that with hearing the clicking of my nails and the vibrations feeding into my fingers as they connect with whatever surface I'm tapping on, and the tiny twinges of the ligaments and muscles after I've done it for an extended period of time... [10] It's incredibly pleasant to process. [11] Also if you can't glean from my description it's a distracting and strong sensation, enough to distract me from all of the extra outside stimulus the average person is able to automatically filter out. [12] You could almost consider it a form of mediation, at least in my case (remember, this disorder is a spectrum, so experiences can vary wildly) since it can calm me down when I'm under a lot of pressure but it also allows me to focus significantly better when needed.

"Why do Depression and Anxiety often occur together? [0] There is indeed a substantial co-occurrence of major depression and various anxiety disorders; while it's inevitably difficult to get accurate numbers, some estimates put it above 50%, with GAD and panic disorder leading. [1] In one of the largest antidepressant trials which didn't try to select for ""pure"" depression, anxious depression was the norm. [2] Why is a much more difficult question, because the root causes of major depression and anxiety disorders are fundamentally not known. [3] Every serious source in the psychiatric literature stresses what we don't know; while there's always someone out there who will give you a clean and intuitive answer about magic brain chemicals, they really shouldn't. [4] Besides, these are clinical diagnoses, which makes it hard to know whether what we're seeing on the surface correlates with one or more underlying issues; imagine trying to figure out the cause of pneumonia without microscopes or the concept of germs. [5] That said, as I once heard it explained, ""we now know a lot more about what we don't know."" [6] One simple explanation is that they share many risk factors, both genetic and environmental.

"Why do we usually see meteors fall to Earth at an angle, but rarely straight down? [0] Because everything in space (with mass) has a relative orbit and gravitational force. [1] In fact, you even have a gravitational force. [2] As the distance to a planet or star gets smaller, its gravitational pull gets stronger. [3] Since the meteor already has a velocity vector (a magnitude and direction) it begins to accelerate towards the planet and it changes direction. [4] So the meteor is still flying in its original direction and speed but now it's being pulled in another direction with additional speed. [5] There are no fixed points in space so an object can't fly directly to a point. [6] Every time it passes anything in space with mass it will move slightly towards it, depending on how much mass the meteor has and how much mass the object has. [7] Imagine you're driving down a straight road doing 75 mph and ahead of you on the side of the road is a powerful magnet. [8] As you get closer to passing the magnet, it's going to pull you towards it. [9] So imagine that when you combine the speed and direction that you're already going with now a force pulling you sideways, you will tend to move you at an angle between the two. [10] Much like how a meteor will enter the earth.

"What is the logic behind a gluten free diet [0] The idea is that gluten sensitivity and intolerance, with reactions less strong than normal Coeliac or Crohn's symptoms, are much more common than most people realise. [1] Because there are differing levels of sensitivity to certain proteins and chemicals, particularly in food, many people may have health issues related to their gluten consumption that have gone undiagnosed throughout their lives. [2] For example, one study on people who had recurring migraines (n=10, so not hugely definitive) found that 7 of them had a significant decrease in their migraine symptoms after excluding gluten from their diets. [3] Other symptoms of gluten sensitivity or intolerance are believed to include non-migraine headaches, sinus congestion, digestive issues that don't have the same characteristics as Crohn's or Coeliac disease, unexplained weight loss (or gain, according to some people), lethargy,  and even Gluten Ataxia. [4] Another school of thought is loosely based on the Paleo/Primal diet and lifestyle, and holds that humans are not evolved to eat as much grains and beans as we do now, and the presence of gluten allergies, sensitivity and intolerances in our population is a sign that we should ditch grains and legumes. [5] Of course, it's becoming more widely known and understood, so a lot of people are going to get on board the bandwagon and potentially misunderstand the reasons behind some people's exclusion of gluten from their diets.",[0] Answer (Summary) [1] Answer (Summary) [2] Others [3] Others [4] Answer (Summary) [5] Others

"How come some people can cry on demand, yet some people can't even after major trauma (Physical/Emotional) [0] There are several types of tears: basal (automatic/lubricating), reflex (sawdust/onion in the eye), and emotional (tears of sorrow, fear, joy, etc.). [1] Each is triggered differently and has a slightly different chemical makeup. [2] They also involve different muscle groups and timing, but all can, to varying extent, be manipulated. [3] Personal observation: [4] My lachrimal ducts and glands were damaged/destroyed in a traumatic incident, so my basal tear production is effectively nil-- a real problem for someone who must wear contact lenses to see effectively. [5] But I've learned to keep my eyes wet by briefly mimicing the facial expressions I had and felt when I was able to cry. [6] (Lots of practice in front of a mirror isolating and contracting facial muscle groups, helped along by genuine frustration.) [7] Having suffered several major physical traumas in my life, I've found that emotional crying doesn't really help relieve physical pain, and is often a real distraction from the work of immediate survival.

[1] Judges decide issues of *law* (who is allowed to testify, what questions are allowed to be asked, who has the burden of proof, what facts must be proved to establish a particular crime). [2] So, for example, in an ordinary rape case, the judge might explain to the jury that they need to decide whether the victim actually consented to a sex act, but in a statutory rape case, the judge might explain to the jury that it doesn't matter whether the minor consented to sex or lied about their age.

"Why do dams have a massive ramp when releasing overflow water? [0] The biggest danger for a dam is undercutting, where the water flowing down the face of the dam swirls around and eats away at or under its base.  [1] But designing a spillway to direct the water away from the face of the dam, you reduce or eliminate that risk.
 [2] Throwing the water into the air also gets rid of a lot of the energy of that falling water. [3] It transmits a lot of it into air that is pulled into the foam, and the air takes the energy away as wind.
 [4] Lastly, the water in a dam has often been still for a long time, and has lost a lot of its oxygen and gained some sulphur chemicals.  [5] That oxygen gets added back in, and the sulphur dispersed, by mixing in a lot of air like this.

"If a drunk 18 year old female has sex with a male under the age of legal consent (say 14), who would be charged with rape?

 [2] You aren't raping a person by having sex with a drunk girl. [3] What's rape is when a girl has had so much booze that she doesn't understand what is happening, can't make decisions at all, and is basically passed out.  [4] This means she is physically unable to consent because she doesn't understand she is having sex and couldn't say yes or no if you asked. [5] People act like the law is that women can cry rape if they wake up and regret the beer goggles. [6] This isn't the case. [7] it's very clear when a person is too drunk to consent and more than that, long before you get to that point they are too drunk to have enjoyable sex, or for you to enjoy the sex (edit:  [8] More than you would with a sex doll).

[4] In this sense a norm is not evaluative , a basis for judging behavior or outcomes ; it is simply a fact or observation about behavior or outcomes , without judgment . [5] Many researchers in this field try to restrict the use of the term normative to the evaluative sense and refer to the description of behavior and outcomes as positive , descriptive , predictive , or empirical .",[0] Others [1] Others [2] Answer (Summary) [3] Answer (Summary) [4] Answer (Summary) [5] Others

"why is ireland not a member of the commonwealth [0] On 18 April 1949 , Ireland formally became a republic in accordance with the Irish Republic of Ireland Act 1948 .  [1] Because it did this , it was automatically excluded from the Commonwealth .  [2] While Ireland had not actively participated in the Commonwealth since the early 1930s and was content to leave the Commonwealth , other dominions wished to become republics without losing Commonwealth ties .  [3] The issue came to a head in April 1949 at a Commonwealth prime ministers ' meeting in London . [4] Under the London Declaration , India agreed that , when it became a republic in January 1950 , it would accept the British Sovereign as a `` symbol of the free association of its independent member nations and as such the Head of the Commonwealth '' .  [5] Upon hearing this , King George VI told the Indian politician Krishna Menon : ``  [6] So , I 've become ' as such ' '' .  [7] The other Commonwealth countries recognised India 's continuing membership of the association . [8] At Pakistan 's insistence , India was not regarded as an exceptional case and it was assumed that other states would be accorded the same treatment as India .  [9] Ireland had withdrawn its participation in the Commonwealth in the 1930s , attending its last Commonwealth governmental heads ' meeting in 1932 .  [10] However it continued to be regarded by the Commonwealth as a Commonwealth member until it declared itself a republic , on 18 April 1949 .

[1] It was first described by Walter Bradford Cannon . [2] His theory states that animals react to threats with a general discharge of the sympathetic nervous system , preparing the animal for fighting or fleeing . [3] More specifically , the adrenal medulla produces a hormonal cascade that results in the secretion of catecholamines , especially norepinephrine and epinephrine .

"what kinds of waves make up the electromagnetic spectrum [0] The electromagnetic spectrum covers electromagnetic waves with frequencies ranging from below one hertz to above 10 hertz , corresponding to wavelengths from thousands of kilometers down to a fraction of the size of an atomic nucleus . [1] This frequency range is divided into separate bands , and the electromagnetic waves within each frequency band are called by different names ; beginning at the low frequency ( long wavelength ) end of the spectrum these are : radio waves , microwaves , infrared , visible light , ultraviolet , X-rays , and gamma rays at the high - frequency ( short wavelength ) end . [2] The electromagnetic waves in each of these bands have different characteristics , such as how they are produced , how they interact with matter , and their practical applications . [3] The limit for long wavelengths is the size of the universe itself , while it is thought that the short wavelength limit is in the vicinity of the Planck length . [4] Gamma rays , X-rays , and high ultraviolet are classified as ionizing radiation as their photons have enough energy to ionize atoms , causing chemical reactions . [5] Exposure to these rays can be a health hazard , causing radiation sickness , DNA damage and cancer .

"what is peak and trough in relation to antibiotic therapy [0] In medicine and pharmacology , a trough level or trough concentration is the lowest concentration reached by a drug before the next dose is administered , often used in therapeutic drug monitoring .  [1] The name comes from the idea that on a graph of concentration versus time , the line forms a U-shaped trough at the lowest region , before a new dose sends it higher again .  [2] The usual criterion is concentration in the blood serum , although in some instances local concentration within tissues is relevant .  [3] It is pharmacokinetically normal that with every passing minute and hour , the drug molecules are being metabolized or cleared by the body , so the concentration of drug that remains available is dropping .  [4] In a medicine that is administered periodically , the trough level should be measured just before the administration of the next dose in order to avoid overdosing .  [5] A trough level is contrasted with a `` peak level '' , which is the highest level of the medicine in the body , and the `` average level '' , which is the mean level over time .  [6] It helps in therapeutic drug monitoring .

[2] In seismology , Love waves ( also known as Q waves ( Quer : German for lateral ) ) are surface seismic waves that cause horizontal shifting of the Earth during an earthquake . [3] Augustus Edward Hough Love predicted the existence of Love waves mathematically in 1911 . [4] They form a distinct class , different from other types of seismic waves , such as P - waves and S - waves ( both body waves ) , or Rayleigh waves ( another type of surface wave ) .

"how did english government change during the glorious revolution [0] The Glorious Revolution of 1688 is considered by some as being one of the most important events in the long evolution of the respective powers of Parliament and the Crown in England . [1] With the passage of the Bill of Rights , it stamped out once and for all any possibility of a Catholic monarchy , and ended moves towards absolute monarchy in the British kingdoms by circumscribing the monarch 's powers .  [2] These powers were greatly restricted ; he or she could no longer suspend laws , levy taxes , make royal appointments , or maintain a standing army during peacetime without Parliament 's permission -- to this day the Army is known as the `` British Army '' not the `` Royal Army '' as it is , in some sense , Parliament 's Army and not that of the King . ( This is , however , a complex issue , as the Crown remains the source of all executive authority in the British army , with legal implications for unlawful orders etc . ) .  [3] Since 1689 , government under a system of constitutional monarchy in England , and later the United Kingdom , has been uninterrupted .  [4] Since then , Parliament 's power has steadily increased while the Crown 's has steadily declined .  [5] Unlike in the English civil war of the mid-seventeenth century , the `` Glorious Revolution '' did not involve the masses of ordinary people in England ( the majority of the bloodshed occurred in Ireland ) .  [6] This fact has led many historians , including Stephen Webb , to suggest that , in England at least , the events more closely resemble a coup d'état than a social revolution .

[2] This feature is useful at any time that the CPU can not keep up with the rate of data transfer , or when the CPU needs to perform work while waiting for a relatively slow I / O data transfer . [3] Many hardware systems use DMA , including disk drive controllers , graphics cards , network cards and sound cards . [4] DMA is also used for intra-chip data transfer in multi-core processors . [5] Computers that have DMA channels can transfer data to and from devices with much less CPU overhead than computers without DMA channels .

"why are my eyes always red in photos [0] In flash photography the light of the flash occurs too fast for the pupil to close , so much of the very bright light from the flash passes into the eye through the pupil , reflects off the fundus at the back of the eyeball and out through the pupil . [1] The camera records this reflected light . [2] The main cause of the red color is the ample amount of blood in the choroid which nourishes the back of the eye and is located behind the retina . [3] The blood in the retinal circulation is far less than in the choroid , and plays virtually no role . [4] The eye contains several photostable pigments that all absorb in the short wavelength region , and hence contribute somewhat to the red eye effect . [5] The lens cuts off deep blue and violet light , below 430 nm ( depending on age ) , and macular pigment absorbs between 400 and 500 nm , but this pigment is located exclusively in the tiny fovea . [6] Melanin , located in the retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) and the choroid , shows a gradually increasing absorption towards the short wavelengths . [7] But blood is the main determinant of the red color , because it is completely transparent at long wavelengths and abruptly starts absorbing at 600 nm . [8] The amount of red light emerging from the pupil depends on the amount of melanin in the layers behind the retina . [9] This amount varies strongly between individuals . [10] Light skinned people with blue eyes have relatively low melanin in the fundus and thus show a much stronger red - eye effect than dark skinned people with brown eyes . [11] The same holds for animals . [12] The color of the iris itself is of virtually no importance for the red - eye effect . [13] This is obvious because the red - eye effect is most apparent when photographing dark adapted subjects , hence with fully dilated pupils . [14] Photographs taken with infrared light through night vision devices always show very bright pupils because , in the dark , the pupils are fully dilated and the infrared light is not absorbed by any ocular pigment .",[0] Answer (Summary) [1] Answer (Summary) [2] Answer (Summary) [3] Others [4] Others [5] Others [6] Others [7] Others [8] Answer (Summary) [9] Others [10] Answer (Summary) [11] Others [12] Others [13] Others [14] Others

 [4] The details are complicated, but oftentimes instead of one vessel connecting itself on both sides, you have several to many smaller vessels forming from both sides, joining up with each other, and ultimately connecting the two sides.  [5] Imagine a big pipe that gets split into smaller pipes that all eventually connect back to the big pipe on the other side.
 [6] That's the simple version. [7] The complicated version involves scar tissue, collagen production and breakdown, a host of hormones and humoral factors, but the bottom line is that vessels do, in fact, re-grow.
 [8] Without the ability to grow new vessels, healing would not be possible.

"Why does the severe weather alert system that broadcasts over your television sound like I'm logging on to the internet in the 90's? [0] It's actually quite intentional.
 [1] The Emergency Alert System is designed to be broadcast in case of any emergency, whether it's a weather alert or a Presidential Alert.  [2] The system doesn't differentiate where the signal is sent, and is broadcast nationally for each alert, but you don't see the ones that don't apply to you because of those tones at the beginning of the broadcast.
 [3] The first time the modem noise is played, the EAS is broadcasting information about the affected area, the type of alert, and the originator to the EAS device located at the station.  [4] This code is then repeated two additional times in order to ensure that the data was correctly interpreted on the receiving end. [5] The receiver at the broadcast station reads this data, determines automatically if the alert is valid for the broadcast area, and cuts into whatever is playing in order to relay the information.
 [6] This is the same principal as the handshake your modem used to connect to the internet, but with different data since certain things are assumed (Baud rate, transmission format, frequency, etc.)
 [7] The three tones at the end of the EAS broadcast are the ""End of Message"" tones.
 [8] TL;dr: [9] It's because the alerts are sent by a system that's pretty close to a modem.

"Why is the U.S. so notorious for using Africans as slaves, when Africans had been using and selling Africans as slaves long before Europeans brought them to the Americas? [0] There is more than one type of slavery.
 [1] In ancient Athens, conquered people became slaves, but their children were born free.  [2] They retired as free people, and it was really more like having your country invaded then being given a job you have to do.
 [3] Others like the Romans would keep foreigners as slaves, and you could be born a slave.  [4] These slaves were invisible though to society - they belonged to a household and had to do the jobs they were given, but they had time off, sometimes got paid, they fell in love and got married and had families.  [5] You couldn't tell if someone walking up the street was a slave or not. [6] These slaves are the ancestors of the European peasant, the common folks.  [7] It was only in about the 17th century or so that we got the idea that people should be allowed to say 'no' if their Lord told them to do something.
 [8] The American South did not view Africans as human beings, but as animals.  [9] They broke up families, they engaged in forced breeding programs where men were beaten until they raped the woman they were told to breed with, they recklessly endangered slaves lives, they did not allow any sort of dignity.

"Why do people get motion sick while being a passenger in a car, but don't get that same sickness if they were to be the driver of that car going to the same location? [0] If you're the driver you're in direct control of the sensations you're experiencing. [1] Its your input on the steering wheel or throttle pedal or whatever that's causing the things you're feeling now; being pulled to one side, or being pushed back in the seat, or being shifted forward into the seatbelt, whatever.
 [2] If you're a passenger, this stuff just happens to you, and some people can deal with that better than others.  [3] Motion sickness is theorised to be caused by a disconnect between what you're feeling and what your eyes are seeing; your brain thinks there's something wrong, so makes you throw up to at least limit the possibility of poisoning.  [4] Some are more sensitive to that disconnect than others and it can work in both ways.

"How do airlines outside of the United States provide such a great experience at a lower cost than those in the U.S.? [0] There are a number of reasons. [1] First, labor is far cheaper in Asia than in the US. [2] The cost of labor is about the same as the cost for fuel for airlines in the US, at around 30% of total airline costs. [3] By contrast, it is usually around 15% for Asian airlines, with fuel being almost 40% of their costs. [4] Second, many Asian airlines are state owned or heavily subsidized by the state. [5] Those states recognize that bringing in people to spend money in their country benefits them. [6] By contrast, airlines in the US are (mostly) privately owned and only benefit by taking you from place to place. [7] Once you step off the plane, they don't get more money out of you until you get back on. [8] Third, the people who fly on Asian airlines tend to be upper class citizens. [9] A far smaller percentage of their population might fly somewhere, and those that do fly tend to be from the upper end of the classes. [10] By contrast, people from a larger variety of the socioeconomic spectrum fly in the US.

"Why do buildings have gravel on top of them? [0] The layer of gravel on a low slope / flat roof is used to help keep the underlay fabric secured and to provide some protection from the elements and human interference.
 [1] This roof type is typically composed of  overlapping layers of tar paper or rubber sheeting separated by tar. [2] Putting a thin layer of gravel (usually river gravel for the smooth edges) on top of the top tar layer will keep the tar from running as much during hot weather thus reducing the risk of a leak developing. [3] It also provides a safer, cleaner, more stable footing for anyone on the roof, as well as protecting the roof from that person's weight.  [4] It keeps hailstones, errant baseballs, etc. from damaging the waterproof seal created by the paper and tar, as well as helping to keep the layers in place.
 [5] Flat roofs in my experience are seldom totally flat. [6] Most of the ones I have been up on had a tiny bit of slope to them to feed water to the edges for removal.

"Why has Walmart struggled overseas when it was able to completely dominate the United States market? [0] I live in Germany, where Walmart spectacularly failed.  [1] The biggest issue seems to be that Walmart failed to understand how cultural differences come into play; among the problems that are blamed for Walmart's failure in Germany are:
 [2] * overambitious expansionist plans that went ahead despite the fact that a German company had successfully fought off a hostile takeover bid, at a time when Walmart was still very small in Germany;
* attempts to cut costs by threatening workers with redundancy if they didn't accept working practices that were borderline illegal in Germany;
* being forced by a German court to comply with German law by publishing financial statements, which revealed that the company was far worse off than it had claimed;
* annoying employees and customers alike by insisting on policies that work well in the US but which Germans find creepy, such as employing greeters, or making staff offer assistance to any customer that comes within range (Germans prefer to be left to shop on their own, and to approach staff if and when they need help).
 [3] The mistake was to fail to understand that laws, expectations and cultural attitudes are very different in other countries, and that not complying with them can sink your business.

 [4] 2) Manipulate curiosity - The VCs noticed that many Americans had a childlike curiosity. [5] So if they planted a Mickey Mouse doll in the middle of the jungle, troops would invariably be like ""wow, what's this doing here?"", pick it up and trigger a bomb.
 [6] 3) Insect warfare - Living in the jungle, VCs were accustomed to seeing scorpions and tarantulas all over the place and quickly realized they freaked out Americans.

"How do automatic guns deal with the heat that would be created from the friction of so many bullets passing through the barrel so quickly? [0] Some automatic guns, typically machine guns, have replaceable barrels that are meant to be interchanged when they overheat.  [1] Some older machine guns were even water-cooled, or had rotating barrels that would share the thermal load (i.e. the classic Gatling gun).
 [2] Otherwise, the barrels are just kept well ventilated so that airflow will cool them off.  [3] Most automatic weapons, like assault rifles, aren't really meant to be fired continuously, so overheating isn't much of a problem in normal use.",[0] Answer (Summary) [1] Answer (Summary) [2] Answer (Summary) [3] Others

"What is the story behind the Bundy vs. BLM standoff? [0] In 1993, to protect the desert tortoise which was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, the BLM modified the terms of Bundy’s cattle grazing agreement.  [1] Bundy refused to comply with the new terms, so the BLM cancelled his permit.  [2] Bundy stopped paying the grazing fees, but continued to let his animals roam the public lands, claiming an ancestral right to the land based on his Mormon family settling there in the 19th century and his belief that federal authority doesn't apply to state land(s).
 [3] As part of an effort to further protect the tortoise, Clark County (NV) purchased all of the active grazing permits in the area and closed it to grazing.  [4] Despite him no longer having a valid legal claim, the government offered Bundy compensation, for water rights and range improvements, for his previously held grazing permit.  [5] He rejected the offer and left his cattle out there.
 [6] The government finally had enough and started rounding up his cattle to move them off of the closed land. [7] Bundy claimed the government was taking away his freedom and a bunch of Tea Party nuts showed up to support him with semi-automatic weapons. [8] The BLM, outnumbered and outgunned, told the protesters that they had to stay within certain 'First Amendment' areas to stage their protests.  [9] This further inflamed the 'right', who began comparing the situation to East Berlin.
 [10] As more anti-government groups, right-wing politicians, and gun-rights activists showed up, pushing turned to shoving and one of Bundy's kids got tasered.  [11] Seeing a Ruby Ridge/Waco situation in the offing, the government backed down, halting the round-up and vowing to continue fighting Bundy in the same courts he's ignored for the past 20 years.

"Why does diarrhea feel hotter than normal poop? [0] Your body feels the transfer of heat not really temperature. [1] Diarrhea is mostly water and water has a high convection coefficient, meaning it transfers heat faster.  [2] Think of it the same effect as biting into a really hot pizza, the cheese burns you more than the crust.  [3] They're both at the same temperature but cheese transfers heat faster. [4] Also, water has high heat capacity, so for every degree of temperature, it has a lot more heat.  [5] Regular feces doesn't have as much water in it so it doesn't transfer as much heat as quickly, that's why diarrhea feels hotter.  [6] Really, no matter what comes out of you, it's at body temperature.
 [7] **TL;DR: Diarrhea is the same temperature as regular feces 98.6F/37C but it transfers heat quicker because it's mostly water so it feels hotter.* [8] **
 [9] Edit: for clarity.
 [10] Edit2: Everyone keeps mentioning acidic diarrhea causing this sensation. [11] What I describe above is why it feels *hotter* not *burning*. [12] The burning feeling is from digestive enzymes, though completely different and distinct when compared to the warmer feeling of shooting liquid out your behind.  [13] Also, one thing I neglected to mention, mostly for simplicity, is that it's not just the convection coefficient of water that helps the transfer of heat happen quicker but also the fact that it is liquid vs solid.

". How can I sit in a ~200° F sauna and not get burned, but water the same temperature spilled on my arm will burn and blister my skin? [0] Both correct answers are here already but neither in the same post with one another. [1] First, water has high heat capacity. [2] That means that even a small change in temperature for water = a ton of energy. [3] So 200 degree water has thousands of times more heat than air for every degree of temperature change, and that's based on MASS. [4] The density of water is much higher than that of air so there's a lot more of it close to you when you're exposed to it. [5] Finally, because of the density, it transfers energy much much faster. [6] Heat is transferred when molecules hit one another - more density means more molecules close together, which means more collisions = faster energy transfer. [7] For an example of this at work try to bake a potato in a 450 deg F oven while boiling one in 212 deg F (boiling) water. [8] Should go alot faster in the water.

"from material science perspective if possible, why we let the food cool down to room temperature before putting it in the freezer or refrigerator.

[5] If you put hot food in the icebox, it would melt the ice faster.  [6] All the ice would melt before the ice man came again and your food would spoil. [7] So it was common practice to let the food cool to room temperature before putting it into the icebox.

"Why do people sometimes get very giddy/laugh uncontrollably after nearly dying? [0] That's a common side effect of the fight-or-flight response. [1] When you're suddenly in a dangerous situation like an incoming car or an animal attack, your brain sends signals to your adrenal glands (little lumpy bits on top of your kidneys) to start producing various hormones, such as adrenaline and dopamine. [2] When that happens, your heart rate increases, your pupils dilate, your hearing is muffled, your digestive system slows down, and your muscles start burning energy faster, all so you can focus on either defending yourself or running away without having to stop and think about it. [3] Of course having all those hormones suddenly flooding into your system has side effects, one of them being giddiness/laughing. [4] This is likely caused by the hormone dopamine. [5] It's typically produced when you feel pleasure, but also when you feel pain (physical and emotional), to help suppress it and calm you down.

"How doesn't the ISS get hit with meteors during showers like the one this week? [0] I actually do this for a living!
 [1] The basic answer is that space is so big you don't have to worry so much about impacts.
 [2] But the larger answer is that we (mankind) has characterized and generalized the meteorite flux to produce tables which say ""for an object/spacecraft with a cross section of 1 square meter, N meteors of X diameter and Y velocity will impact every hour.""
 [3] So you take this table and ask yourself how long you want your spacecraft to last, and how likely you want it be that it actually lasts that long.  [4] For typical spacecraft that might be... 99.9% chance that you last for 8 years without getting destroyed.
 [5] You then use something like a Poison distribution plus your table to find the maximum meteorite size that you need to be able to withstand without being destroyed. [6] And lastly you use a meteor penetration model like Cour-Palais or Schmidt Holsapple (sp?) which were developed back in the Apollo days to choose how thick to a make your hull. [7] Eventually... some time after your 8 years, hopefully... a meteor comes around that is bigger than the limit you designed for and then your mission is over.  [8] But it's ok, because all good things have to end, son.  [9] You're happy.

"How a nuclear reactor works to produce energy. [0] Nuclear reactors use fissionable materials (Usually Uranium or Plutonium) that emit “fast” neutrons naturally through radioactive decay. [1] These neutrons are usually moving too fast to actually be absorbed by the fuel normally, but they do travel into a moderator (usually water because it is stable and doubles as a coolant) that can slow them down by letting the neutrons bounce around a bit, transferring the energy to the moderator molecules in the form of heat. [2] When these neutrons have slowed enough, they are considered “thermalized” and they drift back into the fuel region and are able to be absorbed by the fissionable material which destabilizes it, causing fission which releases a lot more fast neutrons that go and do the same thing. [3] The heat generated by the neutron in the moderator is transferred to a coolant (if they aren't the same thing) and can either cause boiling in the core (such as with a boiling water reactor) or is transferred to a lower pressure system through a heat exchanger called a steam generator which causes boiling in this secondary system (in a Pressurized Water Reactor). [4] The high pressure steam is then sent through a turbine that spins to generate electricity. [5] Any leftover low pressure steam after the turbine has the excess heat transferred out into an outside source of water (coolant tower, lake, river, ocean, etc.) through another heat exchanger called a condenser. [6] The condensed water is then pumped back into the Reactor core or Steam Generator to repeat the process. [7] Each system is self-enclosed and the water never mixes. [8] The neutron creation in the core is controlled by using moveable control rods made out of a material that can absorb neutrons such as boron or by chemically adding the neutron absorber to the core in controlled amounts. [9] The amount of neutron absorber added or Control Rod movement will control exactly how many neutrons are absorbed, preventing them from going back into the core to create more fissions which directly control the heat generated by the reactor, thus the power generated.

"Why do people get motion sick while being a passenger in a car, but don't get that same sickness if they were to be the driver of that car going to the same location? [0] Generally motion sickness (whether car, boat, or video game) is caused by a disagreement between your eyes and the semicircular canals in your ears. [1] In nature there's usually no reason for your eyes to see violent motion that is not being also perceived by your ears (or vice versa) so your body will decide that it is being poisoned (eg: the ""spins"" when you've borderline poisoned yourself with alcohol). [2] The body's only real remedy for poison is to purge so you get nauseous then, if that doesn't solve the problem by making you stop making yourself dizzy, throw up. [3] If you find yourself getting seasick or carsick watch the horizon like it's the most exciting thing ever. [4] Since the horizon is not moving, focusing all your attention on it will make your eyes and ears agree. [5] It also helps to look forward since we're used to looking forward so looking backward or sideways still has things (especially close things) tilting and moving the wrong way for what your balance expects. [6] With video games, you can move farther from the screen or use a smaller screen so that the stationary room provides a frame that anchors you visual perception of motion. [7] source: a sailor prone to seasickness and a gamer prone to gamesickness. [8] The driver has the advantage that they are looking forward with the best view and all of their attention is focused on the farthest things they can see.",[0] Answer (Summary) [1] Answer (Summary) [2] Others [3] Answer (Summary) [4] Others [5] Others [6] Others [7] Others [8] Answer (Summary)

[1] Rather, it's a particular flavour of authoritarianism — the communist dictatorships are most definitely not fascist, as anti-communism is one of the pillars of fascism!
 [2] Fascism was, amongst other things, anti-religious (though they eventually toned that down), whereas both Portuguese and Spanish dictatorships appealed strongly to a catholic base.  [3] Fascism is anti-conservatism, while both Franco and Salazar were quite conservative.

"Why is it that a vast majority of attempted cyber attacks originate from China? [0] Long story short: there are numerous security companies in China whose work primarily consists of attempting to breach foreign companies' databases, some directly on behalf of the Chinese government, some just to sell the information to the highest bidder (oftentimes the Chinese government anyway).  [1] As for the history that led to that point, my knowledge is a little shaky since it's been a while since I've seriously read literature on the subject, so take the following with a grain of salt.  [2] Cyber attacks and information theft are official policy of the PRC, intended to strengthen the country.  [3] As for why there are so many, that's because China simply has more hackers.  [4] From the 1990s to around 2005, China had a large community of patriotic computer hackers who operated independently or in non-government-affiliated groups, yet with the tacit consent of the government (this had to do with their philosophy, which emphasized the role of the everyday citizen in the betterment of the country).  [5] Around 2005, the Chinese government switched its stance and began cracking down on unsanctioned hacking.  [6] Most of the hackers either quit causing trouble, or legitimized into security companies so that they could continue to operate with the approval of the Chinese government.  [7] The government itself also operates several military units dedicated to hacking as well, but those are probably less relevant to you (assuming you don't work for a defense contractor or military R & D company).
 [8] Incidentally, do you know the time stamps for the attempted logins?  [9] The security companies in China tend to operate on a 9-5 schedule, Beijing time.

"Why is it common for animals to birth multiple offspring at a time but rare for humans? [0] As others have posted here, not just humans but many animals tend to birth one offspring, while many others have lots of babies at one time.  [1] As a species you can adopt one of two strategies: you can have lots of babies so that even if some die, others will hopefully survive to the age where they can reproduce.  [2] The disadvantage of this is that you have to spread your love around - you can't spend as much time and attention on each one as you could if you had fewer kids. [3] The other strategy is to have few babies, and pour as much time, love and attention to them as possible to ensure they will survive.  [4] These two strategies are known as [r/K selection theory](_URL_0_). [5] Species like fruit-flies that have tons of kids are r-selected.

"How does our brain ""choose"" how long to sleep? [0] Your brain naturally produces chemicals like melatonin that ""signal"" your brain that it is time to sleep/rest.

"Why are TV and Monitor manufacturers along with TV Cable subscription company's marketing 3840x2160 as 4K when in 4K's native resolution is 4096x2160? [0] 4K 4096x2160 is a digital cinema resolution, similar to 2k in aspect ratio which is 2048x1080.
 [1] The broadcast world uses aspect ratios of 16x9, e.g, 1920x1080, or 3840 x 2160.
 [2] In cinema, there are two overall aspect ratios depending what the content is, if your film is 1.78 - 2.0, people tend to use a flat container, meaning the image is scaled into a 1:1 pixel aspect ratio, introducing letterbox if the active image aspect ratio is greater than 1.89:1.
 [3] For titles with aspect ratios larger than 2, e.g 2.4 or 2.35 or 2.39 and more, they'll use the frame called scope, which has a pixel aspect ratio or 1.5:1.  [4] Basically so they can squeeze more content into a frame, in this case preserving the vertical information more so than the horizontal.  [5] When the image is projected, the image is unsqueezed, preserving more detail or image than would exist in a flat container.
 [6] Broadcast/ consumer electronics are more restricted, in order to broadcast over the air, the distribution architecture decided on 16x9.

[10] When you look at people from remote areas that have had little to no contact with other civilizations, you see they've created language with mostly the same rules and constructs.  [11] When you put people together that can't directly communicate (which was common during the international slave trade), you see that they develop crude ""pigin"" languages, and then those pigins get more complex in the next generation to form a ""creole"", and those higher level languages seem to wind up operating the same way (for the most part).  [12] Groups of deaf people will independently develop their  own language with each other that operations mostly the same way everyone else's language works. [13] I'd recommend Steven Pinker's The Language Instinct for more on this.

"There is no archeological evidence that dragons ever existed. So, if they're simply imagined, how is it that they're present in almost every major culture and depicted so similarly? [0] There are certain things that are common in human mythology , and one of them is that humans are predisposed to be impressed by really big things . [1] And it 's easier to imagine a really big version of something that already exists than to design something completely from scratch .

"Why do so many businesses use computer programs that look like MS-DOS? [0] Changing a business computer system is like rebuilding your house while you're still living in it. [1] It seems like a good idea at the time, so you start building new walls around the outside of your house.  [2] Then when you get about halfway finished your wife gets pregnant and now you have to work an extra bedroom into the new house. [3] So you move something here and alter something there and you can just about get a new bedroom in. [4] But now the house will cost more and it'll take a few more months to get done.
 [5] So your wife now decides that since the new house won't be ready in time she needs to have a new kitchen in the old house, so you stop building the new house and put in a new kitchen.  [6] But now you see some benefits to the new kitchen, so you change your plans and tweak some things so maybe you can use bits of your new kitchen in the new house.
 [7] And then solar panels become a thing, so you decide you want them, which means redoing the roof.
 [8] And then you get a promotion at work and a company car (this is akin to a business getting a new client who works a bit differently from the old clients) so you need to build a garage.
 [9] And then you stand back having lost some weight and lost some hair, and realise that there wasn't anything really wrong with the old house in the first place, it just needed a bit of attention here and there.  [10] But now you have a mish-mash of old house and new house, and the garage is in the pool, and the nursery is nowhere near the main bedroom, and the kitchen is half upstairs and half downstairs, but at least the roof doesn't leak and you still have cable.

[3] If some things had a velocity in one direction and other things had a velocity in another direction, then they would likely end up dragging on each other, slow down, and get pulled in.
 [4] What we think happened is that as the sun was forming, it acquired a spin and that spin ended up transferring to the cloud of material, shaping it into a disc which eventually would collect together to form the planets.

"Why do artists wear an earpiece when performing a concert? [0] These are in ear monitors. [1] If they do not have them they usually have speakers on stage directed at them. [2] The problem with performing a music piece is that you do not hear how the music sounds when you are in the middle of it. [3] The normal speakers are pointed towards the public and sound moves quite slow though the air. [4] So you might perform a guitar solo on one side of the stage and hit every beat as you hear the bass guitar on the other side of the stage and it sounds perfect to you. [5] However to the public it sounds like you are too slow and quiet because the sounds takes some time to go from the bass guitar across the stage to you. [6] So to make sure you hear the beat and the music as the public hear it you need to monitor the sound coming though the sound system.
 [7] Before sound systems small bands used to stand much closer together on the stage and look at each other rather then out to the public.

"why is my ignorance of the LAW not an excuse, but a cop's ignorance of the LAW is? [0] Short answer is that the officer in question wasn't charged with a crime. [1] Ignorance of the law is not a defense to criminal charges, which is what people normally mean when they say ignorance of the law is no excuse (and that is, more or less, true).  [2] The Heien ruling wasn't about any alleged criminal behavior on the part of the officer, it was about whether a stop was constitutional or not.
 [3] The standard for a constitutional stop is not the same as the standard for criminal behavior. [4] An officer doesn't need to know you've broken the law to stop you, an officer needs to have a reasonable belief that you've broken the law to stop you.  [5] In the Heien case, the vague language of the NC law made the officer's mistaken understanding reasonable.  [6] This is, by the way, in keeping with years of Supreme Court precedent.  [7] For a police officer to violate your rights they need to know that they are doing so (or at least a reasonable officer would know that their actions violated your rights).

"How is the ketogenic diet at all healthy if you're eating lots of fats, which clog arteries? [0] Put in a very simple way:
 [1] Fat does not clog arteries by itself, fat deposits on blood vessel walls as a protective measure, against damaged caused to the lining by other things, mainly, sugar.  [2] its a protective measure to prevent further damage to the vessels, and to the blood constituents, the issue is that damage accumulates and so does fat unless lifestyle is changed.  [3] In the early 20th century when people saw clotted arteries with fat, calcium etc, they erroneously assumed that those dietary elements were the factor that was causing the issue, without realising that they were blaming the defensive measure for the problem.  [4] Sadly medicine is this giant machine that takes ages to acknowledge information is inaccurate, and even longer to start changing how it deals with it, it takes decades.  [5] And analogy: [6] They saw a huge traffic jam, they saw shinny lights (cops) and blamed the cops for the jam, instead of realising the cops are there because there was a car crash, which is the true factor to blame for the jam.
 [7] Ketogenic and vegetarian diets are good to help reduce and even reverse those issues, because you are removing the factors that cause damage to the inner lining of the blood vessels (excess sugar), also helps with diabetes as you prevent constant insulin spikes which lead to insensitivity.  [8] Fats are needed by the body, and quite healthy in themselves, yes, even saturated which is quite important for you, the issue is also how much you eat.

[3] The trade off is they don't have the vast resources of the printing companies to match colour as well - so colours are often off when compared to brand cartridges.

"Why are polar bears and grizzly bears considered different species if they can interbreed and produce fertile offspring? [0] It's very difficult to group living, evolving organisms into discrete categories.
 [1] Polar bears diverged from the rest of the *Ursus* genus very recently, therefore they are still genetically similar enough to other bears to produce fertile offspring.
 [2] Taxonomy is also based on physical appearance. [3] Since polar bears are  quite distinct from other species of bears in terms of their physical appearance and geographical habitat, the decision was made to consider them a separate species.
 [4] Doves and pigeons are another example. [5] There are 310 species of birds within the *Columbiformes* order (which encompasses all pigeon and dove families), many of which are capable of breeding with other species and producing fertile offspring.  [6] Their classification as separate species lies mainly in their physical differences.
 [7] The long and the short of it is that taxonomy is a human construct, and not everything fits nice and neatly between the lines all of the time.
 [8] **Tl;dr:** while this typically isn't the case, there is no hard, taxonomic rule stating that members of different species cannot produce fertile offspring.

"Why large store chains closing down? [0] Retail has always been a challenging business due to cash flow issues for maintaining inventory, selecting the correct inventory, etc.  [1] Certainly eCommerce has hurt a great deal... both because people choose it out of convenience and also because it allows for easy price comparison shopping. [2] It cuts down on margins and means stores have to be more competitive on pricing as well as experience.

"If you bear a resemblance with a stranger, are they more closely related to you than other strangers are? [0] Your appearance is defined by multiple genes and multiple pathways. [1] For example you can share a similar face through inheriting different set of genes. [2] So ""external"" similarity doesn't necessarily imply shared ancestry. [3] Height for example is a multifactorial trait which depends among other things on nutrition, it's hard to say you **aren't** related to someone because he/she hasn't the same height. [4] Other backdraw, since you inherit half of your genetic material from one of your parents it's hard to trace certain traits like ""oh he has that kind of nose or hair* we have something in common"" (without having the pedigree of both subjects you are comparing). [5] Maybe he inherited those traits from a russian father while you got them thanks to your irish mother instead of your russian father. [6] Also, -broadly speaking- the same genes are present in most of the populations or ethnicities, the diversity is derived from the frequency of said alleles (or variants within the genes) within the populations.

"Why are people against mandatory background checks before buying a gun? [0] In the US, there's already a [mandatory background check](_URL_0_) to buy a gun in a retail setting (if you buy a new or used gun from a store, you will have a background check).  [1] Further, because the federal government can regulate sales of things that cross state lines, it's illegal for two people to sell a gun privately without involving a retail store (and thus a background check) if they don't reside in the same state.  [2] There isn't a background check on private sales within most states. [3] So when someone says, we want mandatory background checks on all gun sales, they mean they want them on private, in state gun sales.

"Could you Explain Schrödinger's Cat to me LI5? [0] The cool thing about the experiment is that it's really quite simple, so I'd explain it to a 5 year old the same way I would to an adult.
 [1] There's a box with a cat in it. [2] Also in the box is a bottle of poison. [3] If the cat inhales the potion, it will instantly die.
 [4] Now let's say that the bottle has a 50/50 chance of already haven broken. [5] Because it's in a box, there's no way for us to be sure what has happened, and no way for the outcome to effect us.  [6] It's not until we open the box that we can see if it's dead or alive.
 [7] Schrödinger's point was that if we can not see the outcome of a random thing like this, for all intents and purposes the cat is simultaneously dead and alive, and stays like that until you observe otherwise.

"Why the Black Lives Matter protesters are targeting Bernie Sanders? [0] Bernie Sanders participated in one of the earliest sit-in protests against segregation, and helped to desegregate schools. [1] He attended the 1963 March on Washington and saw the ""I have a dream"" speech in person. [2] He endorsed Jesse Jackson for president, twice. [3] BUT, a few weeks ago he was at an event with Martin O'Malley (the other guy in the democratic race) that was interrupted by BlackLivesM [4] Matter protesters. [5] O'Malley, in response to the protesters and shouting, and probably in a clumsy attempt to agree, said “Black lives matter. [6] White lives matter. [7] All lives matter,” which many took to be a very condescending and mistaken understanding of the whole point of that phrase. [8] Sanders was ... also there? [9] He tried to say something about economic inequality but none of it seemed satisfying to the protesters and he left the stage. [10] So, a lot of uninformed people started to see him as an ""old white guy who doesn't get it"", despite him having a better record on this than literally anyone in the race. [11] EDIT: Also, Bill Clinton has an excellent record regarding minority issues and was admirably called ""the first black president"". [12] Of course that was long before Obama, at a time when most people thought we wouldn't get a real black president in our lifetimes.

"A classic argument is: the universe can't come from nothingness, because something can't come from nothingness; Stephen Hawking says yes it can; Brian Greene says current theory states that nothingness is actually a type potential; doesn't that make nothingness something after all? [0] So the problem here is that you're dancing around the semantic problem of defining ""nothingness"".  [1] In physics, nothing is *nothing*: even empty space is a frothing sea of quantum foam with particles spontaneously popping in and out of existence constantly.  [2] Inside the universe, there is no such thing as ""nothing"".  [3] In that context, from what we think we might possibly know about ""before"" the universe, it's possible that our universe spontaneously sprang from ""nothing"" in the same way that particles out in empty space spring up from ""nothing"".  [4] There might be a potential for universes to exist, and our universe is the result of that potential.
 [5] But that brings up another semantic point: what was ""before"" the universe?  [6] Well, there is no ""before"", because time is a function of the universe.  [7] You can't say ""before"" the universe because that requires a dimension of time that's moving in one direction.  [8] Imagine a line starting at one point and going infinitely off in one direction. [9] What's on the line before it starts? [10] There *is no line* before the line starts.
 [11] We're using words and concepts that necessarily must exist within our universe and according to its rules to try to describe something that exists outside of those boundaries.

/u/thef1guy  [1] The U.S strategy is what military planners call 'funnelling'.

 [2] Also, a car battery only produces about 500 watts, which is not enough for some high power uses.  [3] Your car's electrical wiring and fuses are not designed to deliver more power than that.

"How are consumable meats cultured in labs? [0] Actually we all start out as a lump of cells when we were still an embryo. [1] When cells divide, you will grow in size and your cells will start to specialize in certain functions (for example skin cells can absorb sunlight).  [2] Thus by absorbing enough nutrients, the lump of cells can divide and grow into a human.
 [3] Now if you want to grow meat, the process is more complex.  [4] Main problem is that the cells will try to specialize into a task. [5] So you add drugs to stop the process. [6] Also your Petri dish will run out of nutrients as the cells kept dividing non-stop, thus it will be better if you use an entire tank of cell culture instead.  [7] Just keep refilling the tank until the meat is ready.
 [8] Keep in mind though this is VERY expensive. [9] Controlling the enviroment (temperature, pressure......) is not easy and it cost at least $10000 for a pound of lab grown meat.

"Why are there so many fire doors that aren't allowed for regular use? [0] Limiting access to emergency stairwells should ensure that they are in the proper condition to be used in an emergency.
 [1] There is often a concern in places like a university or a hospital that people will congregate in stairwells. [2] Either to do something they are not supposed to do, or for whatever reason people seem to love stairs.  [3] Seldom used stairwells can become a prime place for storing old furniture or other equipment that makes evacuation hazardous when there is a real emergency. [4] Additionally, many emergency fire doors lead to parts of a building that are not designed for regular access.  [5] (I am looking at a fire door that leads to a creepy underground tunnel which terminates in an alley two blocks from the building. [6] I would not want random people walking through that door thinking they are going directly out to the street and then getting lost in the emergency egress tunnel.)
 [7] Underlying your question is another question, why do buildings need so many otherwise useless fire exits?  [8] Large institutional fires are horrific, and the death toll often results from lack of access to means of egress.  [9] If you have a fire in your building, you want as few wrongful death lawsuits as possible, the easiest way to save people (other than not having any fires, which is attempted though less obvious then fire doors), is having lots of visible means of safe exit.  [10] Lastly, the more I see a fire exit that I can't use, the more I think about it and hopefully in a fire I would rush towards that fire door that I never use but always think about rather then the overflowing regular exit.",[0] Answer (Summary) [1] Answer (Summary) [2] Others [3] Others [4] Answer (Summary) [5] Others [6] Others [7] Others [8] Answer (Summary) [9] Answer (Summary) [10] Answer (Summary)

Why does the price of gold fluctuate so much? [0] Comments are mostly right. [1] The bit being missed is that people aren't always trading gold.

"Why are the ceilings in so many grocery stores so high? [0] The greatest benefit to height is in the event of a fire. [1] Higher ceilings allow more time for smoke and heat to accumulate before affecting things closer to the floor (e.g., people, fire load/combustibles). [2] The height also can allow for fire suppression systems that cover a greater area with fewer components, such as sprinkler heads. [3] In addition, it is generally easier to control the climate in a larger space with larger air volumes (exchanges per hour) that are not as noticeable in one spot. [4] (Except for those annoying freeze-or-fry areas where air flows are concentrated.) [5] The air handlers in these systems can also be configured for use following a fire to assist in evacuating smoke from a building, either by exhaust or pressurizing the building (negative and positive pressure ventilation, respectively). [6] Construction costs would tend to be slightly higher because of the longer (higher) columns required, which in turn need to be stronger because of (typically) larger roof systems such as bar joists or trusses. [7] Such costs can be somewhat offset by reducing the number of columns required. [8] When designers are tasked to create 'open space', regardless of low or high ceilings, larger columns with stronger roof systems allow column spacing to be increased, thus 'opening' the space. [9] However, this is not always the case, such as in multi-story structures where significant weight/loads on higher floors require different column sizes or spacing (e.g., airports, parking ramps, hotels). [10] Operating costs do tend to be higher, but it is a trade off on the desired space/affect and what is considered reasonable operating expense. [11] Such factors are taken into consideration during the design phase of projects, so the owner/operator knows early-on what to expect. [12] These factors also contribute to changes in a design if costs are deemed to be unreasonable or exceeding targets/goals. [13] Source: Engineer by day, Firefighter by night.

"How does the silencer on a gun work? [0] A gun is loud for two reasons. [1] 1: any gun which fires a bullet which breaks the sound barrier is impossible to suppress without slowing the bullet. [2] Part of the sound is the sonic boom created by the bullet breaking the sound barrier.
 [3] 2: The way that a gun fires is to create enough pressure behind the bullet the push it out the barrel of the gun. [4] There are very hot gasses which expand very quickly. [5] A suppressor (also known as a silencer) slows the expansion of the gas outside of the barrel. [6] If you were to disassemble a suppressor, you would see it is basically a tube with small holes that feed into another chamber.

"How come people don't borrow from low-interest rate countries like Japan and deposit it in high-interest rate countries like Argentina? [0] Victor, this occurs regularly, although it is difficult for individual investors to do.
 [1] The trade you are discussing has happened in the past, and is likely happening today.  [2] In finance parlance, this is known as a carry trade.  [3] The best known carry trade was in the 90's, going short (selling, or owing) the Japanese yen and going long (buying, or owning) the US dollar.
 [4] The key to the carry trade is exactly what you described. [5] It is not simply a matter of being short one currency and long another, but it is being short one currency and long another with a view towards profiting off of the interest rate differentials.  [6] In the JPY/USD example, you would be selling JPY that had interest rates of near 0% and buying the USD with interest rates of near 5%.  [7] So, you are paying a near 0% interest rate per year towards people you owed JPY, but receiving a 5% interest rate per year from your ownership of USD.  [8] If, on a relative basis, the JPY appreciates (gets more expensive) by 5% or more per year, you would lose money as this would wipe out your gains from the interest rate differential.  [9] If the currency moves the other way, with JPY getting cheaper relative to USD, you could stand to make a lot of money this way.  [10] If the currencies remain flat, on a relative basis, you would be pocketing the 5% per year interest rate differential.
 [11] One of the reasons this is hard for individuals to do is that you are unlikely able to borrow at headline interest rates unless you have sizable banking relationships. [12] In addition, there are numerous risks, including currency exchange rate movements (one currency getting cheaper or more expensive relative to the other), interest rate changes (thus removing the positive interest rate differential you are gaining), among others.",[0] Answer (Summary) [1] Others [2] Others [3] Others [4] Others [5] Others [6] Others [7] Others [8] Others [9] Others [10] Others [11] Answer (Summary) [12] Answer (Summary)
