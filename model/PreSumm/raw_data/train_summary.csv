summary,ELI5,Why are polar bears and grizzly bears considered different species if they can interbreed and produce fertile offspring?,7ndrvj,ds14dx0,"It's very difficult to group living, evolving organisms into discrete categories.

Polar bears diverged from the rest of the *Ursus* genus very recently, therefore they are still genetically similar enough to other bears to produce fertile offspring.

Taxonomy is also based on physical appearance. Since polar bears are  quite distinct from other species of bears in terms of their physical appearance and geographical habitat, the decision was made to consider them a separate species.

Doves and pigeons are another example. There are 310 species of birds within the *Columbiformes* order (which encompasses all pigeon and dove families), many of which are capable of breeding with other species and producing fertile offspring. Their classification as separate species lies mainly in their physical differences.

The long and the short of it is that taxonomy is a human construct, and not everything fits nice and neatly between the lines all of the time.

**Tl;dr:** while this typically isn't the case, there is no hard, taxonomic rule stating that members of different species cannot produce fertile offspring.

summary,ELI5,What is the story behind the Bundy vs. BLM standoff?,22xg64,cgreg7s,"In 1993, to protect the desert tortoise which was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, the BLM modified the terms of Bundy’s cattle grazing agreement. Bundy refused to comply with the new terms, so the BLM cancelled his permit. Bundy stopped paying the grazing fees, but continued to let his animals roam the public lands, claiming an ancestral right to the land based on his Mormon family settling there in the 19th century and his belief that federal authority doesn't apply to state land(s).

As part of an effort to further protect the tortoise, Clark County (NV) purchased all of the active grazing permits in the area and closed it to grazing. Despite him no longer having a valid legal claim, the government offered Bundy compensation, for water rights and range improvements, for his previously held grazing permit. He rejected the offer and left his cattle out there.

The government finally had enough and started rounding up his cattle to move them off of the closed land. Bundy claimed the government was taking away his freedom and a bunch of Tea Party nuts showed up to support him with semi-automatic weapons. The BLM, outnumbered and outgunned, told the protesters that they had to stay within certain 'First Amendment' areas to stage their protests. This further inflamed the 'right', who began comparing the situation to East Berlin.

As more anti-government groups, right-wing politicians, and gun-rights activists showed up, pushing turned to shoving and one of Bundy's kids got tasered. Seeing a Ruby Ridge/Waco situation in the offing, the government backed down, halting the round-up and vowing to continue fighting Bundy in the same courts he's ignored for the past 20 years.

The density of water is much higher than that of air so there's a lot more of it close to you when you're exposed to it.  Finally, because of the density, it transfers energy much much faster.

There are no fixed points in space so an object can't fly directly to a point. Every time it passes anything in space with mass it will move slightly towards it, depending on how much mass the meteor has and how much mass the object has. Imagine you're driving down a straight road doing 75 mph and ahead of you on the side of the road is a powerful magnet. As you get closer to passing the magnet, it's going to pull you towards it. So imagine that when you combine the speed and direction that you're already going with now a force pulling you sideways, you will tend to move you at an angle between the two.

summary,ELI5,How come people don't borrow from low-interest rate countries like Japan and deposit it in high-interest rate countries like Argentina?,2umsnl,co9y9wt,"Victor, this occurs regularly, although it is difficult for individual investors to do.

The trade you are discussing has happened in the past, and is likely happening today. In finance parlance, this is known as a carry trade. The best known carry trade was in the 90's, going short (selling, or owing) the Japanese yen and going long (buying, or owning) the US dollar.

The key to the carry trade is exactly what you described. It is not simply a matter of being short one currency and long another, but it is being short one currency and long another with a view towards profiting off of the interest rate differentials. 

In the JPY/USD example, you would be selling JPY that had interest rates of near 0% and buying the USD with interest rates of near 5%. So, you are paying a near 0% interest rate per year towards people you owed JPY, but receiving a 5% interest rate per year from your ownership of USD. If, on a relative basis, the JPY appreciates (gets more expensive) by 5% or more per year, you would lose money as this would wipe out your gains from the interest rate differential. If the currency moves the other way, with JPY getting cheaper relative to USD, you could stand to make a lot of money this way. If the currencies remain flat, on a relative basis, you would be pocketing the 5% per year interest rate differential.

One of the reasons this is hard for individuals to do is that you are unlikely able to borrow at headline interest rates unless you have sizable banking relationships. In addition, there are numerous risks, including currency exchange rate movements (one currency getting cheaper or more expensive relative to the other), interest rate changes (thus removing the positive interest rate differential you are gaining), among others.","['Victor, this occurs regularly, although it is difficult for individual investors to do.\n', 'The trade you are discussing has happened in the past, and is likely happening today.

They are mostly water with very thin membranes as their body structure. Any sharp object can rip them apart fairly easily. Of course, there are lots of larger jellies that have evolved to be more durable, or can grow big enough to withstand damage (like the Stygiomedusa gigantea, or the larger fried egg jellyfish specimens). But the vast majority are small and mostly helpless, except for their unique stinging cells, but that doesn't affect their ability to survive in a tank.

In their natural environment, they usually just float freely with the currents in the open ocean, so there's nothing for them to bump up against (except predators). They aren't strong swimmers either, so they can get stranded or trapped easily if the current washes them onto the shore or pushes them into a confined area. 

In order to most closely replicate their natural environment, jellies need tanks with rounded edges to keep from getting stuck in corners, a gentle current to propel them around the tank, and a small amount of food suspended in the water. They have very specific requirements for temperature and water pH, but I don't know those details, you could probably find them on an aquarist website, though.

summary,Web-GPT,how are different types of cheese made?,376vh6,Human demonstration,"Differences among types of cheese can generally be attributed to the origin of the milk used, the type(s) of molds and bacteria added, and the length(s) of ageing. 
Most cheese is made from cow's milk, but milk from other animals, particularly goats and sheep, is also used. The composition of milk can depend on the type and breed of animal, the season and geographic location, and the health and nutrition of the animal. 
Additionally, different molds or bacteria are added depending on whether the cheese is soft ripened or hard. Soft ripened cheeses such as Camembert and Brie have a mold added to the surface. This mold produces a protein-digesting enzyme that breaks down the curd during ripening, creating a runny texture. Harder cheeses can be made using either mesophilic starter bacteria or thermophilic starter bacteria. Swiss cheese varieties made using thermophilic starter bacteria can withstand higher processing temperatures, and the subsequent bacterial growth creates the characteristic gas hole or ""eyes.""

When some crystals are added they act as centres for more molecules to form round.

But there's something else too.  Sodium acetate, like many substances, incorporates molecules of water in its crystals - in this case three per molecule, a trihydrate. So when it crystalizes it uses up all the water in the mix so the whole thing goes solid instead of forming a slush.

So now you have a large population from a specific region all working the same type of business. After a while new immigrants come over and they want to find work, if they are lucky enough a cousin or something came over before them and is now a business owner. So they go work with their family members. The first immigrant who opened the business now has a bunch of family members working for them and might want to expand.

Seriously though, they're useful for legal matters - rather than having a relatively inflexible constitution, in theory our laws come from God, to the Queen and are more malleable as the Queen puts a lot of trust in her judges and Law Lords.

She gives ""Royal Assent""* - a kind of seal of approval to any laws made by our leaders in Parliament or the House of Lords.

Additionally, the Royal family are handy for tourism and international politics. They can often be useful diplomats or representatives. They have a lot of training in this field.

Our military is loyal to the Crown, and not any individual political party.

Our government is chosen by the monarch after an election. She will (only) choose what the people have voted for, but the government rules by her consent.*

The wage gap is simply taking all income of full time earners of men vs women in the country and comparing them.  

This ""gap"" of all overall earned income between the sexes doesn't take into account actual hours worked, education level, position, fields they elect to go into, etc.  Women as a whole tend to work less hours, in jobs that are less stressful/dangerous, have more flexibility with hours and choose to go into fields that are generally less paying than men.

There's a lot of propaganda and misleading information in the news/media that try to make people believe otherwise, but it goes against all facts and data.  It's more of a politically correct argument than a sound/rational one.

The truth is that women are more likely to get a degree and in nearly all metropolitan areas of the US single, childless women earn more than men.

In the 19th, or possibly 18th, century a German dude named Blumanbach(?) tried to divide the world up into 3 great races; Negroid were black Africans; Mongoloids were east Asians (what Americans mean when the say ""Asian""); Caucasoids were European, North African and Asians from Europe to somewhere in India.

**This whole thing was psuedoscience** but it did not try to divide people by skin tone, rather it was by skull features. Anyway, this dude had a skull of a woman from Georgia which he designated to have the definitive features of all Caucasoid people and theorized that this was where the first Caucasoid people originated.

The term was used in US legal system for who was allowed to enter the USA. So in 1922 when a Japanese dude who had white coloured skin wanted to become naturalised they wouldn't allow him because he wasn't Caucasion, then one year later when a dude from India who was Caucasion said ""hey I want to become a citizen"" the supreme court said ""Yeaaah, about that, we know you are caucasion but we really only meant white caucasions, so fuck you"". Thus to Americans caucasian means people from Europe (although plenty of west Asians and North Africans are white). It is a silly term and shouldn't be used for anyone that's not from the Caucasus region.

Also Hispanic and Arabic have nothing to do with skin colour. And when Americans say Asian they don't include about half of Asia. Sometimes Americans will get offended if you point out that Asia includes many more people or that their are white Hispanic and Arabic people, but they are just silly-Billies.","['The Caucasus mountains are not in central Asia they are in Eastern Europe and Western Asia.', 'Europe and Asia are one land mass (along with Africa) where Europe ends and Asia begins is arbitrary and down to historical reasons.', 'These mountains are one of the arbitrary geographical features that divides Europe from Asia (along with the Urals farther north).', 'In the 19th, or possibly 18th, century a German dude named Blumanbach(?) tried to divide the world up into 3 great races; Negroid were black Africans; Mongoloids were east Asians (what Americans mean when the say ""Asian"");', 'Caucasoids were European, North African and Asians from Europe to somewhere in India.', '**This whole thing was psuedoscience** but it did not try to divide people by skin tone, rather it was by skull features.', 'Anyway, this dude had a skull of a woman from Georgia which he designated to have the definitive features of all Caucasoid people and theorized that this was where the first Caucasoid people originated.', 'The term was used in US legal system for who was allowed to enter the USA.', 'So in 1922 when a Japanese dude who had white coloured skin wanted to become naturalised they wouldn\'t allow him because he wasn\'t Caucasion, then one year later when a dude from India who was Caucasion said ""hey I want to become a citizen"" the supreme court said ""Yeaaah, about that, we know you are caucasion but we really only meant white caucasions, so fuck you"".', 'Thus to Americans caucasian means people from Europe (although plenty of west Asians and North Africans are white).', ""It is a silly term and shouldn't be used for anyone that's not from the Caucasus region."", 'Also Hispanic and Arabic have nothing to do with skin colour.', ""And when Americans say Asian they don't include about half of Asia."", 'Sometimes Americans will get offended if you point out that Asia includes many more people or that their are white Hispanic and Arabic people, but they are just silly-Billies.']","[1, 4, 5, 7, 8]","[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[False, False, False, False, False, False, True, False, False, False, False, False, False, False]","[False, False, False, False, False, False, False, True, False, False, False, False, False, False]","[True, False, False, True, True, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False]",

Is this injustice? Some may think so, but there are very good arguments that it is not.

Imagine that the status of every piece of property, everywhere in the world, could be called into question, with its current owners called up to pay for the crimes of their ancestors centuries ago. Where would it end? Could the descendants of the Romano-Celts in Britain sue the Saxons? Could the Saxons sue the Normans? Could one American Indian tribe be sued by another for something that happened before European colonization?

A functioning system of property rights requires that a cutoff point be established, beyond which no appeals can be made. (The moral basis for this principle is that someone living today is not responsible to the victims of his ancestors many generations ago.) In a capitalist system, this turns out to be the best for everyone, as anyone who ""unjustly"" starts off with more than his ability would grant him, because his ancestors were conquerors, gradually sinks down to the mean level of wealth, just as the aristocrats in Europe gave way to the capitalist *nouveau riche*.

Furthermore, the Indian tribes' claims to ""ownership"" of land were very often invalid, as the land was not owned by individuals, but ""collectively"", and was often not developed, but simply roamed over (however, there were exceptions, such as the Cherokees, who Westernized but were still unjustly deported).

summary,ELI5,Why was the historical development of beer more important than that of other alcoholic beverages?,65nyid,dgbvtwh,"Beer (and wine and mead) come first. All other alcoholic beverages are products of refining (properly ""distilling"") the various beers into stronger mixtures.

So to make vodka, for instance, one makes a potato mash, then ferments that mash into potato beer, then uses heat and condensation to separate the alcohol from the water, concentrating the beer into a liquor.

So beer isn't ""more important"" as a comparison of equals, it's a predicate. So the invention of the wheel is more _significant_ than the invention of the tire, because you have to make the wheel _first_ and wrapping that wheel with padding makes it into a tire.

Without the predicate the follow-on technology never happens.

So without beer there are no other alcoholic beverages.

In general the historians talking about this subject are talking about the ""big three"" - beer, wine, and mead - when they talk about the discovery of beer. Since wine needs specifically grapes, and mead needs the domestication of honey, while beer can be made from any grain or sugar in general, it's something of an understood generalization.

There is far more beer-making land throughout the cradles of civilization than there is wine or mead producing land.

So the beer is though to come before the domestication of bees for mead, the domestication of the grape for wine, the domestication and enrichment of fruit trees for cider.

So the various grain beers was likely first and foremost, and certainly lead to the invention of the other alcohols.

summary,ELI5,What is it like to have a sense of smell?,2es05y,ck2hn14,"I'll use hearing as an analogy, since it's closest in my mind.

Imagine that every chemical in the world made its own sound.  I don't mean like the difference between the musical notes A# and D, but like the difference between a flute playing A# and a blender with rocks in it.  Smell is that rich and complex of an experience, compared to the simpler colors  &  brightness of vision.

Like sounds, you can smell things over long distances without direct line of sight, and it's hard to completely block out, even if you pinch off the pass to the organ sensing it.  Some smells drown out others, and some come through clearly no matter what (like a baby crying).  Some smells are pleasant and stir emotions (particularly primal ones like hunger, lust, and safety), and some are incredibly annoying or even painful.  

Some differences are that you filter out background smells faster and more completely than sounds; you don't usually smell yourself at all, whereas you do hear a distorted version of your own voice always.  It's harder to be overwhelmed by odors unless they come from gasses that cause other physiological effects (e.g. ammonia), whereas deafening sounds will cause permanent damage.  It's hard to impossible to burn out smell from overexposure to non-toxic chemicals.  On the other hand, bad smells can make it hard to breathe and make you nauseous.

I can only imagine eating without smell would be like watching a movie without sound and subtitles.

summary,ELI5,Why is it that muscle knots on your back/neck/shoulders are indicative of high levels of stress?,4i8bx7,d2w09ty,"This is 2 questions. You pretty much posted the answer to why knots can be associated with stress. That is, prolonged tension, overuse, and poor positioning can basically damage muscle fibers which is one of the several mechanisms which most professionals generally agree can lead to knots (myofascial trigger points).

Stress can cause these because it puts the person persistently in a ""fight or flight"" mode. The brain may respond with a hormone release (norepinephrine  &  others) which has a cascading effect through the body that results in tense muscles and postures. Your brain is basically saying hey body, you need to be ready to react and move, so be a little tense. If it lasts a long time it is thought to cause possible damage to muscles.

summary,ELI5,What is the logic behind a gluten free diet,1rhj3z,cdnb1pa,"The idea is that gluten sensitivity and intolerance, with reactions less strong than normal Coeliac or Crohn's symptoms, are much more common than most people realise. Because there are differing levels of sensitivity to certain proteins and chemicals, particularly in food, many people may have health issues related to their gluten consumption that have gone undiagnosed throughout their lives. For example, one study on people who had recurring migraines (n=10, so not hugely definitive) found that 7 of them had a significant decrease in their migraine symptoms after excluding gluten from their diets. Other symptoms of gluten sensitivity or intolerance are believed to include non-migraine headaches, sinus congestion, digestive issues that don't have the same characteristics as Crohn's or Coeliac disease, unexplained weight loss (or gain, according to some people), lethargy,  and even Gluten Ataxia.

Another school of thought is loosely based on the Paleo/Primal diet and lifestyle, and holds that humans are not evolved to eat as much grains and beans as we do now, and the presence of gluten allergies, sensitivity and intolerances in our population is a sign that we should ditch grains and legumes.

Of course, it's becoming more widely known and understood, so a lot of people are going to get on board the bandwagon and potentially misunderstand the reasons behind some people's exclusion of gluten from their diets.","[""The idea is that gluten sensitivity and intolerance, with reactions less strong than normal Coeliac or Crohn's symptoms, are much more common than most people realise."", 'Because there are differing levels of sensitivity to certain proteins and chemicals, particularly in food, many people may have health issues related to their gluten consumption that have gone undiagnosed throughout their lives.', 'For example, one study on people who had recurring migraines (n=10, so not hugely definitive) found that 7 of them had a significant decrease in their migraine symptoms after excluding gluten from their diets.', ""Other symptoms of gluten sensitivity or intolerance are believed to include non-migraine headaches, sinus congestion, digestive issues that don't have the same characteristics as Crohn's or Coeliac disease, unexplained weight loss (or gain, according to some people), lethargy,  and even Gluten Ataxia."", 'Another school of thought is loosely based on the Paleo/Primal diet and lifestyle, and holds that humans are not evolved to eat as much grains and beans as we do now, and the presence of gluten allergies, sensitivity and intolerances in our population is a sign that we should ditch grains and legumes.', ""Of course, it's becoming more widely known and understood, so a lot of people are going to get on board the bandwagon and potentially misunderstand the reasons behind some people's exclusion of gluten from their diets.""]","[1, 2, 5]","[2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[True, False, False, False, False, False]","[False, True, False, False, True, False]","[True, False, False, False, False, False]",

For example you can share a similar face through inheriting different set of genes. So ""external"" similarity doesn't necessarily imply shared ancestry. Height for example is a multifactorial trait which depends among other things on nutrition, it's hard to say you **aren't** related to someone because he/she hasn't the same height. 

Other backdraw, since you inherit half of your genetic material from one of your parents it's hard to trace certain traits like ""oh he has that kind of nose or hair* we have something in common"" (without having the pedigree of both subjects you are comparing). Maybe he inherited those traits from a russian father while you got them thanks to your irish mother instead of your russian father.

Also, -broadly speaking- the same genes are present in most of the populations or ethnicities, the diversity is derived from the frequency of said alleles (or variants within the genes) within the populations.

summary,ELI5,Why are the ceilings in so many grocery stores so high?,2sdkyv,cnohlgh,"The greatest benefit to height is in the event of a fire. Higher ceilings allow more time for smoke and heat to accumulate before affecting things closer to the floor (e.g., people, fire load/combustibles). The height also can allow for fire suppression systems that cover a greater area with fewer components, such as sprinkler heads. In addition, it is generally easier to control the climate in a larger space with larger air volumes (exchanges per hour) that are not as noticeable in one spot. (Except for those annoying freeze-or-fry areas where air flows are concentrated.) The air handlers in these systems can also be configured for use following a fire to assist in evacuating smoke from a building, either by exhaust or pressurizing the building (negative and positive pressure ventilation, respectively). Construction costs would tend to be slightly higher because of the longer (higher) columns required, which in turn need to be stronger because of (typically) larger roof systems such as bar joists or trusses. Such costs can be somewhat offset by reducing the number of columns required. When designers are tasked to create 'open space', regardless of low or high ceilings, larger columns with stronger roof systems allow column spacing to be increased, thus 'opening' the space. However, this is not always the case, such as in multi-story structures where significant weight/loads on higher floors require different column sizes or spacing (e.g., airports, parking ramps, hotels). Operating costs do tend to be higher, but it is a trade off on the desired space/affect and what is considered reasonable operating expense.

summary,ELI5,Why do dogs live a shorter life than humans?,227n14,cgk4w2s,"Let's say that a species is being successful if it can continually create viable offspring and replace it's individual organisms at least as fast as they are dying. 

There's multiple paths to this in terms of reproductive strategies. One strategy, is to maximize the number of offspring, even if that reduces the chances of any particular individual surviving. An alternate strategy is a lower number of offspring, but taking more care to ensure their survival. Dogs are somewhere in the middle, while humans are basically at the far end of the ""fewer offspring"" side.  

And following those different paths through evolution has resulted in significant biological differences. The human brain is significantly more capable than a dog's, but it also needs much more time to fully develop to the point where you get a human being capable of self preservation and successful reproduction. 

A wolf (which dogs were bred from) is physically and mentally fit enough to reproduce and care for its offspring within a couple of years of its birth, can create a few litters of puppies, and then get old and die within a decade. Over that same 10 years, a human baby will still not even be developed enough to live on its own, much less create and care for a baby. 

If you assume about 15 years for a human to develop enough to be in a position to successfully create and care for a child, and then another 15 years for them to care for their child to the point where that child can be independent, then that's 30 years. And that's just for one kid. 

Before modern medicine came around, children died much more often, so the average mother might give birth to 5+ kids, so you're looking at being 35+ when your last child doesn't need you any longer.

* stage 2, your brain waves start to slow down (iirc waking, your brain has a 'frequency' of ~20 cycles per second, as this slows you become more relaxed and eventually fall asleep)
* stage 3, this is 'deep sleep', usually the period where people experience erratic sleep behaviour such as sleepwalking, wetting the bed etc
* stage 4, now your brain is pretty much only producing delta waves, frequency of around 1-4 cycles per second... so slooooow! If you are woken from this stage, you will feel VERY groggy and disoriented

summary,ELI5,How a nuclear reactor works to produce energy.,4gjagn,d2i17um,"Nuclear reactors use fissionable materials (Usually Uranium or Plutonium) that emit “fast” neutrons naturally through radioactive decay. These neutrons are usually moving too fast to actually be absorbed by the fuel normally, but they do travel into a moderator (usually water because it is stable and doubles as a coolant) that can slow them down by letting the neutrons bounce around a bit, transferring the energy to the moderator molecules in the form of heat. When these neutrons have slowed enough, they are considered “thermalized” and they drift back into the fuel region and are able to be absorbed by the fissionable material which destabilizes it, causing fission which releases a lot more fast neutrons that go and do the same thing. The heat generated by the neutron in the moderator is transferred to a coolant (if they aren't the same thing) and can either cause boiling in the core (such as with a boiling water reactor) or is transferred to a lower pressure system through a heat exchanger called a steam generator which causes boiling in this secondary system (in a Pressurized Water Reactor). The high pressure steam is then sent through a turbine that spins to generate electricity. Any leftover low pressure steam after the turbine has the excess heat transferred out into an outside source of water (coolant tower, lake, river, ocean, etc.) through another heat exchanger called a condenser. The condensed water is then pumped back into the Reactor core or Steam Generator to repeat the process. Each system is self-enclosed and the water never mixes. The neutron creation in the core is controlled by using moveable control rods made out of a material that can absorb neutrons such as boron or by chemically adding the neutron absorber to the core in controlled amounts. The amount of neutron absorber added or Control Rod movement will control exactly how many neutrons are absorbed, preventing them from going back into the core to create more fissions which directly control the heat generated by the reactor, thus the power generated. tl;dr: Hot core creates steam which pushes a turbine around which generates power.

summary,ELI5,Why do manufacturers make different types of screw heads?,4t9lgn,d5fm3mn,"The format (apart from the tool standard) follows function and/or aesthetics - conic flat heads for when they need to be flush with the surface for example.

Now, for the tool standard, they differ due to cost, application, evolution, competing standards, etc.

The old simple slotted head is cheap to make and good for hand turning, but when you use an electric tool, they make it dufficult to keep the driver centered, so you start needing something different.

The phillips type was developed with this in mind; it's self-centering, but they are also more prone to get damaged if the tool slips or a lot of torque is needed. For this case, the allen is better (albeit not self centering, but good for automated robot assembly).

But hey, with excess torque it's also possible to damage the screw head - specially with the wrong size due to the metric/imperial mess of allen tools. Let's come up with an evolution - torx.

summary,ELI5,How does an ant not die when flicked full force by a human finger?,8mnqkv,dzp5wyo,"Multiple reasons:

The exoskeleton of the ant distributes the force more quickly across its entire body (due to being more stiff than fluffy human tissue), protecting more vulnerable parts.

The small size makes it more resistant to blows - this is because volume (and mass) scales faster than surface area (r^3 instead of r^2). So smaller objects have a larger surface area per unit mass, which makes them move more easily even with light forces (like wind). The mass is what causes inertia (""pushing back"" against your finger while you apply the force) and the force is distributed over its surface area. So your applied force is distributed across a relatively large (compared to its volume) surface area (leading to a relatively low pressure), while the low mass (very low, due to aforementioned scaling) makes it easy to move. This means you won't be applying your force for more than a fraction of a second before the ant is moving along with your finger, no longer receiving any significant force. Since you're not applying this force over any time (or distance), the total energy transferred into the ant is very small. This, combined with the effective armor exoskeleton, is why it's difficult to kill insects by swatting them into empty space, but if you push them against a solid object, they squash easily.

TL;DR: Resistant exoskeletons and general properties of small objects make them less likely to be crushed by an outside force.

True ELI5: It's like trying to break a balloon by punching it in midair. The punch is certainly hard enough, but the balloon just kind of gets pushed away.

summary,ELI5,Why does air come up from underwater in bubbles instead of a constant flow of air,4wqzu2,d69bv3h,"When you have air under water, the water molecules would rather be next to other water molecules rather than air molecules.



By forming a bubble, the air molecules are able to form a shape which minimizes the amount of air which is next to a water molecule.



Another way to think about it:  Imagine a giant field packed with 100,000 Boston Red Sox fans and 10,000 Yankee fans.  The Yankee fans are greatly outnumbered and dispersed in a crowd of Red Sox Fans.  Given that a Yankee fan would much rather be next to another Yankee fan than a Red Sox fan, we can imagine that any Yankee fan would look around and try to walk towards the nearest group of Yankee fans so that they could cheer together.  Once there were enough Yankee fans in one area, they would form into a circle, so that only the Yankee fans on the outside had to be next to Red Sox fans, and the rest of them could be surrounded by other Yankee fans.



If you want to go even deeper, the Yankee fans could move towards the edge of the field if they were close enough to see it, so that only one side of them had to be next to the Red Sox fans, as they would rather stand next to a wall than next to a Red Sox fan.  Then they would form a semi-circle.

summary,ELI5,How come some films that were made 20 years ago are now available on Blu-Ray?,olaax,c3i6zqy,"Films that were shot on real film (35mm) can be scanned again and a HD copy be made for BluRay release.

You see, film is great. Really great. So great, that even today, Digital Cinematography cameras like the RED One, Epic, Phantom, Cinealta, Arri, Panavision and such are trying to keep up with what film can really do.

Film captures a great detail of grays and very natural colors, and despite the fact that is was created more than 100 years ago, film is still the bar used to measure digital equipment.

So film is better than HD 1080p, as a matter of fact, digital projectors in theaters are about 4K resolution in order to keep up with what film could do.

I have not shot a single foot of film for four years. Digital Cinematography it's getting there, and the speed and price of the process works in favor of digital.

Hope it helps

Bugs are almost never typos, they can be, but this is rarely the case as if you just misspell a variable, for example, your code simply won't compile. Basically, you push Go! and the computer just laughs at you in this case.

More often in any kind of software, not just games mind you, the code interacts in a way that the programmer didn't expect. For example, the programmer thought that some variable, X, could _never_ be a negative number. Then, when the code (game, in our case) is running, it ends up being a negative number, and the code interacts in a way the programmer never expected it to.

This normally happens at a large level because several, if not dozens or even hundreds, of programmers are all writing on the same code, meaning they cannot possibly account for every single thing that could go wrong.

Yes.

At some point in the future Morgoth will escape the void and bring about the end of the world.

It is very much like Ragnarok, with the free peoples (elves, good men, dwarves etc.) on one side and the forces of darkness on the other.

summary,ELI5,"What happens if I inject a needle(medicine, drugs, etc) into myself and it isn't into a vein? For example into my palm, or in a random place on my arm.",3wunwb,cxzimz9,"MD here. Lots of medications are meant to be injected either under the skin into the fatty tissue (subcutaneous/SC) or into muscle tissue (intramuscular/IM). For example, insulin and some blood thinners are injected SC, while most vaccines are given IM. A lot of medications can be given either intravenously (IV) or IM or SC. The main difference with the SC/IM routes is that the drug will be absorbed into the bloodstream more slowly, which may be preferable in certain situations. However, other medications can be disastrous if they leak out of a vein (""extravasate""). These are often highly concentrated, hyperosmolar solutions such as hypertonic saline, calcium chloride, or the IV contrast used for CT scans. The result is often necrosis (death) of the affected tissue, pain, swelling, and compartment syndrome, which can cut off blood supply to the affected extremity and lead to amputations. When it comes to recreational drugs like heroin, the intensity of the ""high"" is relative to how fast the drug gets into the brain. Injecting into a vein, therefore, is going to deliver the drug to the brain in a high concentration within seconds, with the resulting ""rush"" that IV heroin users are chasing. If you miss the vein, the heroin is probably going IM or SC, so it will get into the bloodstream, and the brain, more slowly, with a less intense high. A lot of long-time heroin users have scarred up their veins so much that they have to resort to ""skin popping"", which is basically SC or sometimes a more superficial ""intradermal"" injection.

summary,ELI5,Why Google Chrome tabs can consume up to 100-150 megabytes of memory while many of them consist just of kilobytes of javascript?,nr60w,c3bb6pi,"I am not a chrome expert, but there are a number of possible reasons:

The biggest offender is probably the chrome sandbox. To limit the damage should someone figure out how to hack the browser, each ""tab"" is walled off from the others by running each in a separate process. Part of the increased security comes from the processes having separate memory. The downside is that each tab is essentially a full copy of the application, and that results in a lot of redundant memory usage.

Another is likely to be memory management strategy. It takes computing power to go off and free the ram when you're done using it. In a language like javascript this typically means halting execution and looking for objects which are no longer needed. What this means is that it makes more sense to wait until you're out of memory before you go off trying to free some up. 

I know there are (at least used to be) places in the code where the javascript engine would intentionally leak memory on shutdown because it's faster for the OS to dismiss it (on exit) then to go through a full shutdown.

summary,ELI5,Why do artists wear an earpiece when performing a concert?,6a4tto,dhbonf1,"These are in ear monitors. If they do not have them they usually have speakers on stage directed at them. The problem with performing a music piece is that you do not hear how the music sounds when you are in the middle of it. The normal speakers are pointed towards the public and sound moves quite slow though the air. So you might perform a guitar solo on one side of the stage and hit every beat as you hear the bass guitar on the other side of the stage and it sounds perfect to you. However to the public it sounds like you are too slow and quiet because the sounds takes some time to go from the bass guitar across the stage to you. So to make sure you hear the beat and the music as the public hear it you need to monitor the sound coming though the sound system.

Before sound systems small bands used to stand much closer together on the stage and look at each other rather then out to the public.

- Releases your stored glucose, or robs some protein from your muscles to convert into glucose if you have not eaten adequately, in order to raise your blood sugar levels so your muscles have fast energy available.

- Pushes blood through the body more quickly by restricting the arteries and raising your heart rate.

These give you the feeling of a ""second wind"", allowing your body to manage the physical stress you are putting on it (fight or flight).

Combine that with the fact that most programs at the time did not support multi-core CPUs, AMD gave way for Intel. Fast forward to 2014 and Intel knew that AMD weren't a threat anymore, as a result Intel gotten lazy at generational improvements, causing them to ""milk"" the CPU market for time to come. Fast forward to the present and AMD needs to respond badly, and Zen is their last ditch effort at it.
