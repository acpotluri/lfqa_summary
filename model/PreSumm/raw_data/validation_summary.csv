summary,ELI5,Why is hand flapping a behavior common to many people with autism?,65aa7o,dg8v7f2,"I have high functioning autism and while I don't do the hand flapping thing, I will on rare occasions drum my fingers. I don't do it often enough or in rigid enough contexts to consider it a full blown stim, but I do find myself doing the motion in mid-air when I'm trying to remember something during conversations. I usually drum my fingers against something when I'm extremely stressed or trying to find a solution to a problem or scenario.

Like a majority of people with autism I have Sensory Processing Disorder, sometimes referred to as hypersensitivity. It dials my senses up to eleven and my brain does not have the ability to tune out portions of my environment or any surrounding stimulus, everything is processed at roughly the same level and understandably can be very overwhelming. It takes a lot of focus to be able to 'tune in' to certain things; in my case spoken words if there are multiple sources of background noise, but it can be almost anything you would try to process/learn. Visuals, smells, questions on a test, etc.

Stims are self stimulating behaviors that sort of comfort and calm the person doing them. In the cases in which I'm drumming my fingers I can very clearly feel the interior movements of my fingers joints and how that interior motion is unbelievably smooth within the joint itself. Combine that with hearing the clicking of my nails and the vibrations feeding into my fingers as they connect with whatever surface I'm tapping on, and the tiny twinges of the ligaments and muscles after I've done it for an extended period of time... It's incredibly pleasant to process. Also if you can't glean from my description it's a distracting and strong sensation, enough to distract me from all of the extra outside stimulus the average person is able to automatically filter out. You could almost consider it a form of mediation, at least in my case (remember, this disorder is a spectrum, so experiences can vary wildly) since it can calm me down when I'm under a lot of pressure but it also allows me to focus significantly better when needed.

I hope that helps, I'm happy to try and answer more questions or elaborate further if needed.","[""I have high functioning autism and while I don't do the hand flapping thing, I will on rare occasions drum my fingers."", ""I don't do it often enough or in rigid enough contexts to consider it a full blown stim, but I do find myself doing the motion in mid-air when I'm trying to remember something during conversations."", ""I usually drum my fingers against something when I'm extremely stressed or trying to find a solution to a problem or scenario."", 'Like a majority of people with autism I have Sensory Processing Disorder, sometimes referred to as hypersensitivity.', 'It dials my senses up to eleven and my brain does not have the ability to tune out portions of my environment or any surrounding stimulus, everything is processed at roughly the same level and understandably can be very overwhelming.', ""It takes a lot of focus to be able to 'tune in' to certain things; in my case spoken words if there are multiple sources of background noise, but it can be almost anything you would try to process/learn."", 'Visuals, smells, questions on a test, etc.', 'Stims are self stimulating behaviors that sort of comfort and calm the person doing them.', ""In the cases in which I'm drumming my fingers I can very clearly feel the interior movements of my fingers joints and how that interior motion is unbelievably smooth within the joint itself."", ""Combine that with hearing the clicking of my nails and the vibrations feeding into my fingers as they connect with whatever surface I'm tapping on, and the tiny twinges of the ligaments and muscles after I've done it for an extended period of time..."", ""It's incredibly pleasant to process."", ""Also if you can't glean from my description it's a distracting and strong sensation, enough to distract me from all of the extra outside stimulus the average person is able to automatically filter out."", ""You could almost consider it a form of mediation, at least in my case (remember, this disorder is a spectrum, so experiences can vary wildly) since it can calm me down when I'm under a lot of pressure but it also allows me to focus significantly better when needed."", ""I hope that helps, I'm happy to try and answer more questions or elaborate further if needed.""]","[8, 13]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]","[False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, True, False]","[False, False, False, False, False, False, False, True, False, False, False, False, False, False]","[False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, True, False]",

summary,ELI5,Why does every steam game I install need to install it's own copy of directx?,30k3v1,cpt7pgf,"Running the DirectX installer is not a matter of making sure your overall DirectX install being up-to-date. Microsoft has a helper library with D3D called D3DX. You'll find binaries for this like d3dx9_43.dll in your Windows\system32 folder. There are over 40 different versions of the D3DX library for D3D9 alone, and many more for D3D10 and 11 as well. Each game that uses the D3DX helper library is linked to a specific version. As such the game must run the correct D3D installer version that it was specifically compiled with to ensure the binaries exist.

Even if a later version of the binary is already installed, that version cannot be used, and even if your DirectX install is up-to-date because you've run a more recent version of the installer that is not guaranteed to have installed all previous versions. Even worse, if a version is installed for x86 it doesn't guarantee the same version is installed for x64, so 64 bit and 32 bit games may need to run the same exact installer version but targeting different platforms when run.

Furthermore, Microsoft's licensing terms prevent anyone from distributing the files directly, the only way to distribute them is to run the installer, that's also the only supported method from Microsoft to check that the correct version installed. Trying to manually check for the correct versions is extremely complicated because there are numerous files that must all be present and individual system configuration options like dll search paths complicate the situation. In addition, the dependencies and required checks may change in each new version of the D3DX runtime. The code to check correctly and repair broken installs all exists in the installer and running it is a guarantee that the correct binaries will exist when you run the game and prevents lots of bad cases where a game would fail to launch with an obscure error if a windows install was either missing the correct version or somehow corrupted in the past.

summary,ELI5,Do ex-prisoners who have been found not-guilty a while into their wrongful sentencing receive any compensation for their unnecessary time in prison?,1vzi61,cexbz83,"It depends on a lot of factors.

For instance, some states will only pay *exonerated* prisoners.  Note that being ""exonerated"" is different from being found ""not guilty"" on appeal or at a new trial. ""Exonerated"" is defined by some states as being absolutely ruled out as a guilty person-- for instance, by DNA evidence.  It is not enough to be found ""not guilty"" on appeal because of, for instance, bad jury instructions.

Other states only offer compensation for people who are convicted because of misconduct by prosecutors or police-- not just a bad jury decision that is later set aside.  That can make getting compensation very hard in cases of coerced confessions (which *do* happen).

In many states, there are legal guidelines for payouts to the wrongfully imprisoned, but the money isn't paid automatically.  People who are wrongfully sent to prison often have to sue to get this money-- and the cost involved in suing can make it hard.

The Innocence Project has a [good guide to which states in the United States have laws to pay the wrongfully imprisoned](_URL_0_).

For instance, Nevada doesn't have any laws to pay people wrongfully sent to prison.  Texas, on the other hand, provides $80k per year in prison, plus $25k per year spent on the sex offender registry, college tuition, and back child support payments-- but only if the wrongfully imprisoned person has been pardoned or ""granted relief on the basis of actual innocence"".

The camera records this reflected light . The main cause of the red color is the ample amount of blood in the choroid which nourishes the back of the eye and is located behind the retina . The blood in the retinal circulation is far less than in the choroid , and plays virtually no role . The eye contains several photostable pigments that all absorb in the short wavelength region , and hence contribute somewhat to the red eye effect . The lens cuts off deep blue and violet light , below 430 nm ( depending on age ) , and macular pigment absorbs between 400 and 500 nm , but this pigment is located exclusively in the tiny fovea . Melanin , located in the retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) and the choroid , shows a gradually increasing absorption towards the short wavelengths . But blood is the main determinant of the red color , because it is completely transparent at long wavelengths and abruptly starts absorbing at 600 nm . The amount of red light emerging from the pupil depends on the amount of melanin in the layers behind the retina . This amount varies strongly between individuals . Light skinned people with blue eyes have relatively low melanin in the fundus and thus show a much stronger red - eye effect than dark skinned people with brown eyes . The same holds for animals .

Electrons can also absorb photons to jump up energy levels - but only if there's the right amount of energy in the photon to do a complete jump. Electrons won't jump up anything but whole energy levels.

This means that there has to be the right amount of energy in the light in order for it to be absorbed. With light, energy is proportional to the frequency, which is inversely proportional to the wavelength. This means there's a direct relationship between wavelength and energy.

This is why glass, for example, is transparent.

Edit: Just wanted to address some of the other comments:

Yes, all service members get to use Tuition Assistance while in. Once you get out, you can use the GI Bill. You can transfer those benefits to a family member if you've been in at least 10 years. I know California and Indiana your child can attend a state school for a certain amount of credit hours (in Indiana where I live it's enough to get a Bachelors), but you often have to have a disability rating--not necessarily a Purple Heart of Medal of Honor. For example, in Indiana you only need a 10% rating. 

The medals OP asked about do have additional benefits. The stuff above is essentially a given, provided you meet the Time in Service requirements and the disability rating requirements. It does help with your medical preference so you have a somewhat easier time getting treated, as if you were given either of these, you'll probably need future treatment.","['Certain medals will let you receive benefits such as compensation, medical preference, educational (for yourself or family), and lower rates on things like license plates, free access to state parks.', 'A lot of it varies by state, though.', 'I wouldn\'t say ""they mean squat"" (especially coming from someone who didn\'t serve in the US military).', '[Purple Heart Benefits](_URL_1_)', '[Medal of Honor Benefits](_URL_0_)', 'Edit: Just wanted to address some of the other comments:', 'Yes, all service members get to use Tuition Assistance while in.', 'Once you get out, you can use the GI Bill.', ""You can transfer those benefits to a family member if you've been in at least 10 years."", ""I know California and Indiana your child can attend a state school for a certain amount of credit hours (in Indiana where I live it's enough to get a Bachelors), but you often have to have a disability rating--not necessarily a Purple Heart of Medal of Honor."", 'For example, in Indiana you only need a 10% rating.', 'The medals OP asked about do have additional benefits.', 'The stuff above is essentially a given, provided you meet the Time in Service requirements and the disability rating requirements.', ""It does help with your medical preference so you have a somewhat easier time getting treated, as if you were given either of these, you'll probably need future treatment.""]","[1, 12, 14]","[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]","[True, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False]","[False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, True, False, True]","[True, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False]",

summary,ELI5,How do airlines outside of the United States provide such a great experience at a lower cost than those in the U.S.?,5oue1p,dcm7x7q,"There are a number of reasons. First, labor is far cheaper in Asia than in the US. The cost of labor is about the same as the cost for fuel for airlines in the US, at around 30% of total airline costs. By contrast, it is usually around 15% for Asian airlines, with fuel being almost 40% of their costs. Second, many Asian airlines are state owned or heavily subsidized by the state. Those states recognize that bringing in people to spend money in their country benefits them. By contrast, airlines in the US are (mostly) privately owned and only benefit by taking you from place to place. Once you step off the plane, they don't get more money out of you until you get back on. Third, the people who fly on Asian airlines tend to be upper class citizens.

summary,Web-GPT,Why do some planets form rings while others form moons?,39ihxw,Human demonstration,"There are several different scientific theories about why some planets have rings and others have moons. One theory is that, when the solar system formed from gas and space dust particles, the space dust formed clumps that became planets. The remaining dust formed moons around some planets, but it was too close to other planets to form stable bodies and formed rings instead. Another idea relates to the planets' proximity to the sun. It's possible that rings, being made of frozen dust, couldn't form on planets closer to the heat of the sun. Some scientists have proposed that the gravitational pull of a planet is the reason for rings or moons. If dust was close to the planet when it formed, the gravitational pull was too strong for the dust to gather into a moon, so it dispersed into a wider ring. A nearby moon or comet driving the planet's gravitational forces could also have interrupted the dust forming a moon and causing it to spread into a ring. One last theory is that the giant planets had the mass and gravity to form miniature solar-system-like disks around themselves and pull in passing objects as irregular moons to form an eccentric ring instead of a system of moons with stable orbits. Smaller planets nearer to the sun were made up of less material and had less space dust around them, so they formed moons through collisions that broke chunks off the planets and sent them into orbit.","['There are several different scientific theories about why some planets have rings and others have moons.', 'One theory is that, when the solar system formed from gas and space dust particles, the space dust formed clumps that became planets.', 'The remaining dust formed moons around some planets, but it was too close to other planets to form stable bodies and formed rings instead.', ""Another idea relates to the planets' proximity to the sun."", ""It's possible that rings, being made of frozen dust, couldn't form on planets closer to the heat of the sun."", 'Some scientists have proposed that the gravitational pull of a planet is the reason for rings or moons.', 'If dust was close to the planet when it formed, the gravitational pull was too strong for the dust to gather into a moon, so it dispersed into a wider ring.', ""A nearby moon or comet driving the planet's gravitational forces could also have interrupted the dust forming a moon and causing it to spread into a ring."", 'One last theory is that the giant planets had the mass and gravity to form miniature solar-system-like disks around themselves and pull in passing objects as irregular moons to form an eccentric ring instead of a system of moons with stable orbits.', 'Smaller planets nearer to the sun were made up of less material and had less space dust around them, so they formed moons through collisions that broke chunks off the planets and sent them into orbit.']","[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]","[0, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2]","[False, True, True, False, True, False, True, False, True, True]","[False, True, False, True, False, True, False, True, True, False]","[False, True, True, True, False, True, False, False, True, True]",

""Good posture"" as I interpret it, is using muscles to support your bones, mainly your spine and sacrum, in their proper alignment.  Using any muscle means using energy and can get tiring after awhile.  When you slouch/relax, you relax those muscles, which can bring on a sense of relief.  However, your bones still have to stay together SOMEHOW.  That support then falls on the ligaments which attach those bones together and the connective tissue capsules around the joints.  If you rely too heavily on the ligaments for support you can overstress them, sprain them, and inflame them leading to pain.

In short, using your muscles to support your posture can be tiring.  The alternative is using ligaments to support you which can result in vertebral and sacral joint pain.

summary,ELI5,"in the USA, why are wait staff tipped a percentage of the food bill, rather than a flat rate?",2yomo8,cpbkktq,"The percentage rate thing basically comes down to perceived consumer control.

Jay Porter, a California restauranteur, transitioned his restaurant from a traditional tip system to a No-tip, flat service fee back in 2006, and wrote a [series of blogs](_URL_0_) describing the experience back in 2013. They're a decent read and a worth a look if you're more interested in the subject, but the long and short of his experience is that people didn't like not being able to punish/reward their servers. He expands that the majority of complaints he got at the restaurant were from men who were upset they couldn't give generous tips to cute female waitresses.

I say *perceived* control above, because (and this is only somewhat related the question posted) the idea that ""servers work harder for good tips"" is covered in Porter's blog and as anyone who's worked in a restaurant knows, is pretty much bunk. Servers get paid more when they work more tables, period. In general, customers tip the same no matter what kind of service they got, extreme cases of bad/good service notwithstanding.

summary,ELI5,"Why do wounds itch when healing, prompting us to scratch and potentially re-damage the area?",2985yt,ciil2rc,"Itching early in the wound healing process is created from histamine. Histamine has been scientifically proven to increase the rate of healing. But it does not itself cause the itching - it causes inflammation and this makes your nerves go nuts. Your skin is covered in nerves and cells that cause the itching sensation from either mechanical motion (bugs, wind, etc), chemical interaction (irritants), and very low-voltage electrical signals. A scientist discovered that the voltage at the base of a wound is different from the regular voltage of the skin elsewhere. Why this is the case is up for debate but the mechanism at work here is that new nerve cells can follow this ever-decreasing electrical signal so they know where to go. Once there and bonded with other nearby cells the wound slowly pulls itself closed. Or if this is early in the process the bonds are stretched and pulled at by the histamine-aided inflammation and produces the same result. Both the inflammation and the repair cause a small variation in the electrical signal and simulate motion.
