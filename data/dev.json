I usually drum my fingers against something when I'm extremely stressed or trying to find a solution to a problem or scenario.\n\nLike a majority of people with autism I have Sensory Processing Disorder, sometimes referred to as hypersensitivity.

There are over 40 different versions of the D3DX library for D3D9 alone, and many more for D3D10 and 11 as well. Each game that uses the D3DX helper library is linked to a specific version.
