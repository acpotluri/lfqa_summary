In the diagram on the right , producing 10 more packets of butter , at a low level of butter production , costs the loss of 5 guns ( shown as a movement from A to B) .  At point C , the economy is already close to its maximum potential butter output .  To produce 10 more packets of butter , 50 guns must be sacrificed ( as with a movement from C to D ) .  The ratio of gains to losses is determined by the marginal rate of transformation . </span>

Some animals are believed to be able to detect earthquakes hours or days before an earthquake hits.</mark> We do not know for certain if this is plausible because it is nearly impossible to do a controlled study on animal behavior prior to an earthquake, but there have been many reports of animals fleeing prior to the onset of an earthquake. One theory for why animals may be able to detect earthquakes so early on is that they are more sensitive to the Earth's vibrations than humans are. Another theory is that they can sense electrical changes in the air. Because some animals, like elephants, pass knowledge on from generation, it may also be possible that some older animals who have experienced an earthquake teach their young how to react to certain geographical signs.</span>

                                            style="font-weight:400;font-style:normal;"><b>Long Answer:</b> There was a time before it only cost $10 for a digital scale to keep in your kitchen. In that time, most recipes were made using volume measurements. In addition, the butter churning process ends with setting your butter in a container to solidify again. </span>
