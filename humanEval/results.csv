While scientists are not entirely certain how birds navigate them, we do know that they use several methods to find their way. Birds can use the sun as a guide, as it rises in the east and sets in the west, allowing them to stay on track on their route south. Similarly, birds can also navigate using the potation of the stars at night as well. Finally, some birds are able to use the Earth's magnetic field in order to navigate, through the use of highly-magnetic minerals in their brains known as magnetite, that can act as a compass and help the birds identify magnetic north.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,

 You aren't raping a person by having sex with a drunk girl. What's rape is when a girl has had so much booze that she doesn't understand what is happening, can't make decisions at all, and is basically passed out.  This means she is physically unable to consent because she doesn't understand she is having sex and couldn't say yes or no if you asked.

Part of the increased security comes from the processes having separate memory. The downside is that each tab is essentially a full copy of the application, and that results in a lot of redundant memory usage.
 Another is likely to be memory management strategy. It takes computing power to go off and free the ram when you're done using it.

What this means is that it makes more sense to wait until you're out of memory before you go off trying to free some up.
